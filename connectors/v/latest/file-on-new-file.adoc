 The `<file:listener>` (shown as `On New or Updated file` in Studio and Flow Designer) polls a directory looking for files that have been created or updated. One message is generated for each file that is found.

 The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. There are three strategies for that:

 * Setting the `autoDelete` parameter to `true`: This will delete each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
 * Setting the `moveToDirectory` parameter: This will move each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as `autoDelete` but without losing the file.
 * Using the `watermarkMode` parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed.
 * A matcher can also be used for additional filtering of files.

Example:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="onNewFile">
    <file:listener config-ref="file" directory="test-data/in" autoDelete="true">
      <scheduling-strategy>
        <fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>
      </scheduling-strategy>
    </file:listener>

    <flow-ref name="processFile" />
</flow>
