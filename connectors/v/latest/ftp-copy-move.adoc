The connector also provides the ability to copy and move files or directories on demand.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ftp:copy sourcePath="source.txt" targetPath="backup" overwrite="true|false" createParentDirectories="true|false" renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
<ftp:move sourcePath="source.txt" targetPath="backup"  overwrite="true|false" createParentDirectories="true|false" renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
----

Take a special look at the `targetPath` and `renameTo` parameters. The `targetPath` is the path to the directory into which the file is going to be copied or moved. This path *MUST* point to a directory.

In some cases, you want to also rename the target file as part of the operation. This operation allows you to automatically rename it through the optional `renameTo` parameter. This parameter must be a file name, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, then the original file name will be kept.
