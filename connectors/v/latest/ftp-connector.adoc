This connector provides access to files and folders on an FTP server. Its main features include:

// INCLUDE FOR file, ftp, and sftp connectors
include::common-file-actions.adoc[]

[[connection_settings]]
== Connecting to an FTP Server

As usual with Mule, connections are established through config elements:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ftp:config name="ftp">
  <ftp:connection username="anonymous" password="password" host="localhost" port="${ftpPort}" workingDir="${workingDir}"/>
</ftp:config>
----
Othen than the host, port, and credential parameters, the `workingDir` is probably the most important connection parameter. The `workingDir` is the path to a directory that is treated as the root of every relative path used with this connector. If the directory is not provided, it will default to the remote serverâ€™s default. Notice that this is exactly the same functionality as the new File Connector, except, of course, that the default value is different.
