This connector provides access to files and folders on an FTP server. Its main features include:

// INCLUDE FOR file, ftp, and sftp connectors
include::common-file-actions.adoc[]

[[connection_settings]]
== Connecting to an FTP Server

You set up a connection through an `ftp:config` element, for example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ftp:config name="ftp">
  <ftp:connection username="anonymous" password="password" host="localhost" port="${ftpPort}" workingDir="${workingDir}"/>
</ftp:config>
----

The `workingDir` provides the path to a directory that is treated as the root of every relative path used with this connector. If the directory is not provided, the remote serverâ€™s default serves as the working directory.
The `username`, `password`, `host`, and `port` attributes are self explanatory.

// Included in FTP, SFTP
