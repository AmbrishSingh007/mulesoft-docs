[[ServiceBusQueueDescription]]
== Service Bus Queue Description

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Lock Duration a| String | Determines the amount of time in seconds in which a message should be locked for processing by a receiver. After this period, the message is unlocked and available for
 consumption by the next receiver. Settable only at queue creation time. Valid values: Range: 0 - 5 minutes. 0 means that the message is not locked. Format: PTx3Mx4S, where
 x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples: PT5M (5 minutes), PT1M30S (1 minute, 30 seconds). | PT1M |
| Max Size In Megabytes a| Number | Specifies the maximum queue size in megabytes. Any attempt to enqueue a message that causes the queue to exceed this value fails. Valid values are: 1024, 2048, 3072,
 4096, 5120. | 1024 |
| Requires Duplicate Detection a| Boolean | Settable only at queue creation time. | false |
| Requires Session a| Boolean | Settable only at queue creation time. If set to true, the queue is session-aware and only SessionReceiver is supported. Session-aware queues are not supported
 through REST. | false |
| Dead Lettering On Message Expiration a| Boolean | This field controls how the Service Bus handles a message with an expired TTL. If it is enabled and a message expires, Service Bus moves the message from the queue into the
 queue's dead-letter sub-queue. If disabled, message is permanently deleted from the queue. Settable only at queue creation time. | false |
| Enable Batched Operations a| Boolean | Enables or disables service-side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus collects and batches multiple operations to the
 back end, to be more efficient with the connection. If you want lower operation latency, you can disable this feature. | true |
| Default Message Time To Live a| String | Depending on whether Dead Lettering is enabled, a message is automatically moved to the Dead Letter Queue or deleted if it has been stored in the queue for longer than the
 specified time. This value is overwritten by a TTL specified on the message if and only if the message TTL is smaller than the TTL set on the queue. This value is immutable
 after the queue has been created. Format: Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples: PT10M (10
 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours) | P10675199DT2H48M5.4775807S |
| Duplicate Detection History Time Window a| String | Specifies the time span during which Service Bus detects message duplication Valid values: Range: 1 second to 7 days. Format: Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2
 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours). | PT10M |
| Max Delivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times Service Bus tries to deliver a message before being sent to the dead letter queue or discarded. | 10 |

[[ServiceBusSubscriptionDescription]]
== Service Bus Subscription Description

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Lock Duration a| String | The default lock duration is applied to subscriptions that do not define a lock duration. You can only set this property at subscription creation time. Valid values: Range:
 0 to 5 minutes. 0 means that the message is not locked. Format: PTx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples:
 PT5M (5 minutes), PT1M30S (1 minute, 30 seconds). | PT1M |
| Requires Session a| Boolean | You can only set this property at subscription creation time. If set to true, the subscription is session-aware and only SessionReceiver is supported.
 Session-aware subscriptions are not supported through REST. | false |
| Dead Lettering On Message Expiration a| Boolean | This field controls how Service Bus handles a message with an expired TTL. If it is enabled and a message expires, Service Bus moves the message from the queue into the
 subscription's dead-letter sub-queue. If disabled, message is permanently deleted from the subscription's main queue. Settable only at subscription creation time. | false |
| Dead Lettering On Filter Evaluation Exceptions a| Boolean | Determines how Service Bus handles a message that causes an exception during a subscription's filter evaluation. If the value is set to true, the message that caused the
 exception is moved to the subscription's dead-letter queue. Otherwise, it is discarded. By default, this parameter is set to true, enabling you to investigate the cause of
 the exception. The exception can occur from a malformed message or some incorrect assumptions being made in the filter about the form of the message. Settable only at subscription
 creation time. | false |
| Enable Batched Operations a| Boolean | Enables or disables service-side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus collects or batches multiple operations to the
 backend to be more connection efficient. If you want lower operation latency, then you can disable this feature. | false |
| Default Message Time To Live a| String | Determines how long a message lives in the subscription. Based on whether dead-lettering is enabled, a message whose Time To Live (TTL) has expired is either moved to the
 subscription's associated DeadLetterQueue, or permanently deleted. If the topic specifies a smaller TTL than the subscription, the topic TTL is applied. Format:
 Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours) | P10675199DT2H48M5.4775807S |
| Max Delivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times Service Bus tries to deliver a message before that message is dead lettered or discarded. | 10 |

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Size In Megabytes a| Number | Specifies the maximum queue size in megabytes. Any attempt to enqueue a message that causes the queue to exceed this value fails. Valid values are: 1024, 2048, 3072,
 4096, 5120. | 1024 |
| Requires Duplicate Detection a| Boolean | If enabled, the topic detects duplicate messages within the time span specified by the DuplicateDetectionHistoryTimeWindow property. Settable only at topic creation time. | false |
| Enable Batched Operations a| Boolean | Enables or disables service side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus collects or batches multiple operations to the
 back end in order to be more connection efficient. If you want lower operation latency, you can disable this feature. | true |
| Default Message Time To Live a| String | Determines how long a message lives in the associated subscriptions. Subscriptions inherit the TTL from the topic unless they are created explicitly with a smaller TTL.
 Based on whether dead-lettering is enabled, a message whose TTL has expired will either be moved to the subscription's associated DeadLtterQueue or is permanently
 deleted. Format: Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds. Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2
 hours). | P10675199DT2H48M5.4775807S |
