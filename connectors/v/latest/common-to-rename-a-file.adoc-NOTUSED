:toc-title: To rename a file or directory

You can use the Rename operation to the File connector in a Mule operation to rename a file or directory on a local file system.

. Select the Rename operation from the File connector in a Mule app.
. Set the Path to the file that you want to rename.
+
If you do not provide a path, the operation will attempt to discover it from the local file attributes associated with the message. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you will receive an error message.
+
. Provide a new name for the file.
. Indicate whether to overwrite an existing file with the same name.
+
Defaults to False.
+
Note that you can provide DataWeave expression, for example, if you want to overwrite certain circumstances but not in others.
+
. [Optional] Perform other tasks, for example:
  ** Set up or select a configuration for the connector.
  ** Provide a Display Name for the connector.
  ** Set a reconnection strategy to if you want to retry the connection to your directory after a failed attempt.
  ** Set up error mapping.
