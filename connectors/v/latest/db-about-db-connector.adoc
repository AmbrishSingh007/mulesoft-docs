Design Center on Anypoint Platform needs to connect to a database on the Internet. The database connector supports the following operations:

* Creating and running stored procedures
* Creating tables using the EXECUTE DDL operation
* Issuing select, insert, update, and delete queries
* Executing inline and file-based SQL scripts
* Performing bulk operations: delete, insert, update
* Operations, such as running DDL statements against the database, using a script

== DataSense in Database Operations

When performing database operations, such as a Select operation, DataSense can help you create queries by showing you the table column names. After creating the query, the connector analyzes the query and compares it to the structure of the tables. For example, if you type the following partial query following by a space, DataSense presents the types of each expected parameter.

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE TYPE =`

You select the type for the list of types.

In the query output, DataSense provides information as shown in the following example:
