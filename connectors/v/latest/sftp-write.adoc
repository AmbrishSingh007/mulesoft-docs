This operation writes a given Content into the given Path on demand. In principle, this seems pretty straightforward, but it does contain a number of usability features to help with the most common use cases.

== Embedded DW transformations

When used in its default form, the connector will write whatever is in the message payload:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sftp:write path="output.csv" />
----

But what happens if the payload is not in csv format and you actually need to make a transformation? You could place a DataWeave transformation before the write operation, but that would cause the message payload to change and impacted the operation placed after the write operation.

To avoid this undesired impact, you can now place the transformation inside the write operation:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sftp:write path="output.csv">
   <sftp:content>#[%dw 2.0

  output application/csv
  ---
  payload.customers.email
  ]
  </sftp:content>
</sftp:write>
----


Now, the transformation can be used for generating the content that will be written and has no side effect on the message in transit.

== Writing into directories

Consider the following:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sftp:write path="a/b/c/myFile.txt" />
----

If any of the a, b, or c directories do not exist, this operation fails by default. However, by setting the `createParentDirectories` to true, the connector will automatically create any missing directories.

== Writing to existing files

There are 3 types of file write modes, which become increasingly important when trying to write to an existing file:

* OVERWRITE: If the file exists, then overwrite it completely
* APPEND: If the file exists, then write at the end of it
* CREATE_NEW: This means that the operation should result in a new being created. If the file is already there, then you will get an error

This operation also supports locking, in a similar fashion to the read operation. The main difference is that the lock will be automatically released once the write operation finishes.
