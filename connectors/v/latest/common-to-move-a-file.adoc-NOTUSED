:toc-title: To Move a File

You can use the Move operation to the File connector in a Mule app to move files from one location in a local file system to another. You can also change the name of the file when moving it.

. Select the Move operation from the File connector.
. Provide the Source Path to the file that you want to move, including the file name.
+
The supplied path must point to a file. Attempts to read a file that does not exist or to read a directory without specifying a file result in a `FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH` error.
+
. Provide the Target Path where you want to move the file.
+
This path must point to a directory.
+
. [Optional] Perform other tasks, for example:
** Rename the new file.
+
The value must be a file name, not a path.
+
** Set up or select a configuration for the operation.
** Create parent directories for the file if they do not exist already.
** Determine whether to overwrite a file with the same name.
** Provide a reconnection strategy.
** Map custom error messages to error codes.

== XML Example

This example moves `full_record.json` to a new location (`/Users/me/testing/out/`) and provides a new file name (`full_record_moved.json`) for the file.

----
<file:move config-ref="File_Config_Out" sourcePath="full_record.json" targetPath="/Users/me/testing/out" doc:name="Move" doc:id="42c72da9-2582-4dfe-9169-faacdbe4aa7b" overwrite="true" renameTo="full_record_moved_.json" />
