= XML Module
:keywords: XML, xpath, xslt, xquery, XSD, validation

//TODO: IS THERE A RELEASE NOT FOR THIS?
//* Release Notes:

The XML Module can process and extract data from an XML document. Although DataWeave is recommended for most XML-related use cases, the XML module should be used for cases that involve the use of XML standards such as XSLT, XPath and XQuery, or XSD.

To use the XML module, you simply add it to your Mule app through the Studio or Flow Designer UI, or you can add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

[source,XML,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-xml-module</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version> <!-- or newer -->
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
