= Microsoft DotNet Connector Reference

[[dot-net-config]]
==  DotNet Configuration

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| * <<External Connection Type>>
* <<GAC Connection Type>>
* <<Legacy Connection Type>>
* <<Resource Connection Type>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime actually purges instances when it sees fit. |  |
