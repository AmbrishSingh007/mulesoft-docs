:toc-title: To Copy a File

You can use the Copy operation to the File connector in a Mule app to copy files that are in a local file system. You can also change the name of the file when copying it.

. Select the Copy operation from the File connector.
. Provide the Source Path to the file that you want to copy, including the file name.
+
The supplied path must point to a file. Attempts to read a file that does not exist or to read a directory without specifying a file result in a `FILE:ILLEGAL_PATH` error.
+
. Provide the Target Path where you want to copy the file.
+
This path must point to a directory.
+
. [Optional] Perform other tasks, for example:
** Rename the copy.
+
The value must be a file name, not a path.
+
** Set up or select a configuration for the operation.
** Create parent directories for the file if they do not exist already.
** Determine whether to overwrite a file with the same name.
** Provide a reconnection strategy.
** Map custom error messages to error codes.

== XML Example

This example copies `full_record.json` to a new location (`/Users/me/testing/out/`) and provides a new file name (`full_record_copy.json`) for the copy.

----
<file:copy config-ref="File_Config_Out" sourcePath="full_record.json" targetPath="/" doc:name="Copy" doc:id="1f86eccf-468d-46ad-9163-83473df81fc5" renameTo="/Users/me/testing/out/full_record_copy.json" overwrite="true" />
