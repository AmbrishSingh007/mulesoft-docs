 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit.+++ |  |

** IMMEDIATE
** AUTO
** MANUAL |  +++Acknowledgement mode to use for the messages retrieved from the subscribers.+++ |  +++AUTO+++ |

| Max Redelivery a| Number |  +++Number of redeliveries to try in case message processing fails. To avoid a poison message, the default value is set to -1 (infinite).+++ |  +++-1+++ |

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  | 
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |

| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  | 
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  | 
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  | 
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE

| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is SHA-256. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  | 
| Object Store a| <<ObjectStore>> | The object store where the redelivery counter for each message is going to be stored. |  |

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of memory that will be allocated in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded by according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much will be buffer size by expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |
