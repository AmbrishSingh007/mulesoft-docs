| Connection a| Connection
| The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
| Expiration Policy a| ExpirationPolicy |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.

| Mule interchange sender/receiver ID qualifier (ISA05/ISA07) a| String |  ID qualifier for Mule in exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Self Identification Interchange ID value, and if one is set the other must also be set. If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the ISA Interchange Receiver ID Qualifier must match this value. On the send side, this value is used as the default ISA Interchange Sender ID Qualifier when not set in the message data. |  |
| Mule interchange sender/receiver ID (ISA06/ISA08) a| String |  ID for Mule in exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Self Identification Interchange ID qualifier value, and if one is set the other must also be set. If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the ISA Interchange Receiver ID must match this value. On the send side, this value is used as the default ISA Interchange Sender ID when not set in the message data. |  |
| Mule application sender/receiver code (GS02/GS03) a| String |  Application Code for Mule in group (GS segment). If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the GS Application Receiver's Code must match this value. On the send side, this value is used as the default GS Application Sender's Code when when not set in the message data. |  |
| Partner interchange sender/receiver ID qualifier (ISA05/ISA07) a| String |  ID qualifier for partner in exchange (ISA segment).

| Form and validation a| Enumeration, one of:

** X12
** HIPAA_SNIP1
** HIPAA_SNIP2 |  Schema form and validation level. Schemas used in the configuration must match the form selected, either X12 or HIPAA. SNIP Type 1 and Type 2 validation only applies to HIPAA schemas. |  X12 |
| Schema definitions a| Array of String |  List of paths for schemas to be used by connector. The paths may be either for file system or classpath. |  |x
| Character encoding a| Enumeration, one of:

** ASCII
** ISO8859_1
** IBM1047
** UTF8 |  Character encoding for messages. This character encoding is always used for both send and receive messages. |  ASCII |
| Character set a| Enumeration, one of:

** BASIC
** EXTENDED
** UNRESTRICTED |  Characters allowed in string data. Invalid characters are replaced by the substitution character, if used, or rejected as errors if no substitution character is set or enabled for receive messages in parser options. Either way the invalid characters are logged, and for receive messages are reported in 997 functional acknowledgments. |  EXTENDED |
| String substitution character a| String |  Substitution character used to replace invalid characters in string values. |  |
| Version identifier code suffix a| String |  Version identifier code suffix for group (GS segment). If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the GS Version / Release / Industry Identifier Code must consist of the X12 schema version (004010, 005010, etc.) followed by this suffix. If this value is not set, the receive only verifies that the GS version identifier code starts with the configured schema version. On the send side, the combination of the X12 schema version and this suffix is used as the GS version identifier code. |  |
| Fail when a value length is outside an allowed range. a| Boolean |  Fail when receive value length outside allowed range flag. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the value is used anyway and the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is logged and reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when an invalid character is in a value. a| Boolean |  Fail when receive value contains invalid characters flag. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the character is either passed through or substituted and the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when there are too many repeats of a value. a| Boolean |  Fail when receive value is repeated too many times. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the value is accepted and the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when an unknown segment is in the message. a| Boolean |  Fail when an unknown segment is present in a transaction set. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the segment is ignored and the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when a segment is out of order in a message. a| Boolean |  Fail when a segment is out of order in a transaction set. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false and the segment can be reordered the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when an unused segment is included in a message. a| Boolean |  Fail when a segment marked as Unused is included in a transaction set. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the transaction is not rejected and the unused segment is ignored. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Fail when there are too many repeats of a segment. a| Boolean |  Fail when a segment occurs too many times in a transaction set. If true, a transaction with this error is rejected; if false, the transaction is not rejected. In either case the error is reported in 997/999 functional acknowledgments. |  true |
| Require unique ISA control numbers a| Boolean |  Reject an interchange if the Interchange Control Number has previously been processed. The normal behavior is to record the interchange numbers previously processed and reject any duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification). If false, this instead allows processing of the received interchange to continue and leaves it to the application flow to track numbers and handle appropriately. |  false |
| Require unique GS control numbers a| Boolean |  Reject a functional group if the Group Control Number has previously been processed. By default, group numbers only need to be unique with an interchange. If true, this instead requires group numbers to be unique across all interchanges received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Require unique transaction set control numbers a| Boolean |  Reject a transaction set if the Transaction Set Control Number has previously been processed. By default, transaction set control numbers only need to be unique with a particular functional group. If true, this instead requires transaction set numbers to be unique across all functional groups received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Acknowledge every received transaction set a| Boolean |  Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set. By default, only transaction sets containing errors are included in the acknowledgment, with transaction sets which aren't included implicitly acknowledged. Changing this flag causes each received transaction set to be explicitly acknowledged. |  false |
| Generate 999 Functional Acknowledgments a| Boolean |  Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than 997 Functional Acknowledgments. By default, 997 Functional Acknowledgment transaction sets are generated for each received interchange. Changing this flag causes 999 Implementation Acknowledgments to be generated instead. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation. |  false |
| Report segment error details to sender (in 997/999) a| Boolean |  Report segment error details to sender in 997/999 flag. If true, the details of any segment errors will be included in a generated 997/999. If false, the details will not be included. |  true |
| Automatically include 997/999 Functional Acknowledgment schema a| Boolean |  Expect 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments and include 997/999 schema. By default, the schema for 997/999 acknowledgment transaction sets is automatically included in the set of schemas used by the X12 EDI Module. If false, you need to directly specify the 997 and/or 999 schema if you want these to be processed as input. The schemas used for generating 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments are hard coded and cannot be modified. |  true |
| Data element separator character a| String |  Optional data element separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  * |
| Component element separator character a| String |  Optional component separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  > |
| Repetition separator character a| String |  Optional repetition separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. The value 'U' means repetitions are not used. |  U |
| Segment terminator character a| String |  Optional segment terminator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  ~ |
| Line ending between segments a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** LF
** CRLF
** CR |  Line ending to add between segments. This allows you to add line endings between segments to improve the readability of the output message text. |  NONE |
| Use unique GS control numbers a| Boolean |  Send unique Group Control Numbers. By default, functional group control numbers are assigned sequentially within each interchange and are reused in different interchanges. If true, this instead assigns unique group numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Use unique Transaction Set control numbers a| Boolean |  Send unique Transaction Set Control Numbers. By default, transaction set control numbers are assigned sequentially within each functional group and are reused in different groups. If true, this instead assigns unique transaction set numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Implementation convention reference (ST03) a| String |  Implementation convention reference for transactions (ST segment). If this value is set, it is used as the ST Implementation Convention Reference unless overridden in the message parameters. |  |
| Initial Interchange control number a| Number |  The initial Interchange Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Initial GS control number a| Number |  The initial Group Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Initial Transaction Set control number a| Number |  The initial Transaction Set Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Request Interchange acknowledgments (ISA14) a| Boolean |  Request acknowledgments for sent transactions flag. If true, 997/999 acknowledgments will be requested for all sent transactions. |  false |
| Default Interchange usage indicator (ISA15) a| String |  Default ISA15 interchange usage indicator ("I" for Information, "P" for Production Data, "T" for Test Data). |  P |
