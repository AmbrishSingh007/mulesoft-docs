= To Trigger a Flow When a New File is Created or Modified

 The `<ftp:listener>` (shown as `On New or Updated file` in Studio and Flow Designer) polls a directory looking for files that have been created or updated. One message will be generated for each file that is found.
 +
 The key part of this functionality is determining that a file is actually new. There are three strategies for that:

 * Setting the `autoDelete` parameter to `true`: This will delete each processed file after it has been processed, causing all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
 * Setting `moveToDirectory` parameter: This will move each processed file to a different directory after it has been processed, achieving the same effect as `autoDelete` but without losing the file.
 * Using the `watermark` parameter to only pick files that have been created/updated after the last poll was executed.
 * Using a matcher for additional filtering of files.

Example:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="onNewFile">
    <ftp:listener config-ref="file" directory="test-data/in" autoDelete="true">
      <scheduling-strategy>
        <fixed-frequency frequency="1000"/>
      </scheduling-strategy>
    </ftp:listener>

    <flow-ref name="processFile" />
</flow>
