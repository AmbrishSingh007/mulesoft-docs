= To List Files in a Directory Using the File Connector
:keywords: file, connector, list, directory
:toc:
:toc-title:

By default, this operation will only list the contents of the given directory, without going into any sub-folders at the root level of the Directory Path and without reading any file that is inside a subdirectory. To enable recursive listing, the `recursive` parameter should be set to true. If a sub-directory is found and recursive is set to true, then the files contained in that subdirectory will be listed immediately after the subdirectory.

In this example, we will list the contents of a folder and handle regular files and subdirectories differently. We do so by using the list operation, which lists all the files and folders in a given Directory Path. This path could be absolute or relative. If the path is relative, then it will be relative from the Configâ€™s Working Directory. The list operation returns a List of messages, where each message represents an item in the directory.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="list">
  <file:list directoryPath="~/dropFolder" />
  <foreach>
    <choice>
      <when expression="#[attributes.directory]">
        <flow-ref name="processDirectory" />
      </when>
      <otherwise>
        <logger message="Found file #[attributes.path] which content is #[payload]" />
      </otherwise>
    </choice>
  </foreach>
</flow>

== Matching
Another common scenario, when listing files, is the need to filter files that match certain criteria.

For that, a `<file:matcher>` element exists. This element defines the possible criteria that can be used to either accept or reject a file. This is how you can define the matcher:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<file:matcher
  filename-pattern="a?*.{htm,html,pdf}"
  path-pattern="a?*.{htm,html,pdf}"
  createdSince="2015-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  createdUntil="2015-07-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  updatedSince="2015-05-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  updatedUntil="2015-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  accessedSince="2015-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  accessedUntil="2015-06-03T13:21:58+00:00"
  directory="true|false"
  regularFile="true|false"
  symbolicLink="true|false"
  minSize="0"
  maxSize="1024" />
----

All of the attributes above are optional and are ignored if not provided. They are all related to each other under an `AND` operator.

A good thing about the file matcher is that it can either be a reusable element (as a named top-level element) or it can also be used as an inner element proprietary to a particular component.

Here are the two ways of using it:

=== Example of top level, reusable matcher

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<file:matcher name="smallFileMatcher" maxSize="100" />

<flow name="smallFiles">
  <file:list path="~/smallfiles" matcher="smallFileMatcher" />
  ...
</flow>
----

=== Example of inner, not reusable, matcher

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="smallFiles">
	<file:list path="~/smallfiles">
        <file:matcher maxSize="100" />
	</file:list>
	...
</flow>
----

== Streaming

This operation leverages the new repeatable streams functionality introduced in Mule 4. It returns a list of messages, each one representing one of the found files. Each of those messages holds a stream to the found file, and that stream is repeatable by default.
