= Simulate Calls to an API

Use the mocking service to mock http requests to your API and to view responses that are based on the API specification that you are creating.

== Before you begin

...

* An example of data the actual implementation would return
* An HTTP status code the API returns if successful

== About this task
Simulating calls to the API is a critical design task that helps you troubleshoot problems and demo the API to prospective users even before you have implemented it. You can simulate calls to the API in Design Center before publishing the API or in Exchange after publication there.

Before you activate the mocking service, the API uses the baseURI value you specified, if any, in the RAML design.

After you activate the mocking service, the mocking service exposes a mock service that you can use for testing in lieu of an actual implementation

[NOTE]
====
You can make actual calls to the API under the following conditions:

* You implemented the API and users can access the REST service.
* You provided the working URI in the baseURI RAML property.
