= Create and Publish an API Fragment in the Code Editor in API Designer




== About this task

An API fragment is a RAML document that has a version and an identifier, but is not in itself a complete RAML specification. An API fragment is one of the following types defined by RAML.org:

* Trait

* Resource Type

* Library

* Type

* User Documentation

* Example

* Annotation Type

* Security Scheme




== What to do next

You can publish the API fragment to Anypoint Exchange. The fragment can then be included as a dependency in an API-specification project. After revising a fragment, update API specifications that use the fragment to include the new version.
