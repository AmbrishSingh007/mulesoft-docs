= Add an API Fragment to an API Project as a Dependency

In projects for API specifications or API fragments, you can add API fragments as dependencies directly from Anypoint Exchange.

== About this task

The fragments are listed in your projects, but are not actually present in them. Instead, the Files list references them from their online location in Anypoint Exchange. Therefore, although you can include them in your specifications and fragments, you cannot edit them.

If you export your project or publish it to Anypoint Exchange, 


If you export a project that contains API fragments that are dependencies, edit these fragments, and then try to import the project back into the RAML editor, the import will fail.


== Procedure

. On the left side of the editor, click the *Exchange dependencies* icon, which looks like this:

. Click the plus sign that is at the top of the left pane.
. Select the API fragments that you want to import. You can select from API fragments that are visible to the organizations that you belong to.


== Result
The API fragments that you selected are listed in the left pane. You can view their contents by selecting them. When you are ready to continue work on your project, click the *Files* icon.

The files appear in the folder `exchange-modules`.

[NOTE]
====

If you add a dependency on an API fragment, an updated version of file is subsequently published, and you want your project to reference the updated version, you must update the dependency. To do so, click the *Exchange dependency* icon, click the dependency, and select *Change version*. In the *Change version* dialog, select the current version.
