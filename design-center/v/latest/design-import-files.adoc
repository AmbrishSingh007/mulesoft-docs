= Import Files into the RAML Editor

You can import files, either separately or bundled together in .zip files, into the projects in which you are creating API specifications and API fragments. The files can be RAML 1.0 files, JSON files, or OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 2.0 files. The files can be on your computer or you can specify a URL for them if they are located online. You can even add API fragments as dependencies directly from Anypoint Exchange.

== Before you begin

* The API Designer converts imported OAS files to RAML. OAS 2.0 does not support all of the features of RAML 1.0. Therefore,
* *??? What does this mean?* Importing a `.zip` file that contains a main OAS file is not supported when that file includes references to JSON files...


== About this task

Importing API specifications::
+
You can include more than one API specification in an API-specification project. You might want to have more than one specification in a project if the specifications are closely related in functionality. When you publish your project on Exchange, you select one of the specifications as the main specification.
+
Additional specifications that you import can be in RAML or OAS. If a specification that you import is written in OAS, the API Designer converts the specification to RAML.

Importing API fragments or adding them as dependencies::
+
Both API specifications and API fragments can include reusable portions that are contained in separate files. For example, suppose you want to use OAuth 2.0 for securing implementations of your API. You might have a security scheme defined in a RAML file named `oauth_2_0.raml` that explains the settings for implementations to use, as well as other info such as headers and responses. You would import `oauth_2_0.raml` into your project or add it as a dependency. Then, in your API specification, you would include the security scheme, as in this example:
+
....
securitySchemes:
  - oauth_2_0: !include oauth_2_0.raml
....
+
Then, use the `securedBy` keyword to refer to the scheme, as in this example:
+
....
securedBy: [ oauth_2_0 ]
....
+
You can import or add as dependencies annotation types, data types, examples of JSON response payloads, libraries, resource types, security schemes, and traits. If you import an example of a JSON response payload, you can also import the JSON schema, so that developers creating their own response payloads can refer to the schema when doing so.



[NOTE]
====
* If you want your imported files in a folder structure in your project, import a `.zip` file that contains the files in that folder structure. You cannot create folders in the RAML editor.
* If you import a file that is available online by providing its URL, be sure that the file contains no `!include` statements. The editor imports only the file that is at the URL.
* You can edit API fragments that you import. However, you cannot edit API fragments that you add as dependencies from Anypont Exchange. If you export a project that contains API fragments that are dependencies, edit these fragments, and then try to import the project back into the RAML editor, the import will fail.

== Procedure

* If you want to import one or more files from your computer or from a location online:
. In the left pane of the editor, click the dots to the right of *Files* and select *Import*.
. In the *Import* dialog, select one of these options:
+
*File or Zip*:: Select this option if you are importing one or more RAML or JSON files that are located on your computer.
*URL*:: Select this option if you are importing a single RAML or JSON file that is available at a location online.
*OAS file or ZIP*:: Select this option if you are importing one or more OAS files that are located on your computer.
*OAS URL*:: Select this option if you are importing a single OAS file that is available at a location online.

+
_Result:_ After you click *Import*, the files are listed in the left pane of the editor. If you imported a `.zip` file that contains the files in a folder structure, the files are listed in that folder structure.

* If you want to add one or more APIs fragment as dependencies from Anypoint Exchange:
. On the left side of the editor, click the *Exchange dependencies* icon, which looks like this:
+

. Click the plus sign that is at the top of the left pane.
. Select the API fragments that you want to import. You can select from API fragments that are in the organizations that you belong to.

+
_Result:_ The API fragments that you selected are listed in the left pane. You can view their contents by selecting them. When you are ready to continue work on your project, click the *Files* icon.
