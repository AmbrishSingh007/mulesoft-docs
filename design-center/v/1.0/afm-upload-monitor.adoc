= Monitor an Uploaded Test Suite

image::early-access-tag.png[]

You can upload a suite of tests that you have written and want to run as a monitor, viewing the results the information displays in the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring.


== Before you begin

* Write a suite of tests in the BDD test-writing language. For information about writing tests, see "API Functional Monitoring with the BAT CLI", which is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.

* Determine the frequency at which you would like the monitor to endpoints in the test suite. The shortest interval is every fifteen minutes. You can also choose to run the monitor hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The schedule begins immediately after you upload the monitor. After you upload the monitor, you can schedule another monitor for the same test suite that is more detailed, if you prefer.
* Determine which execution location you would like to run the test in.
* If you have more than one configuration file in your test suite, determine which you plan to use for the monitor.

== Procedure
To upload a test suite and create a monitor for it:

. In the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring, click *Upload*.
. Upload the folder that contains your test suite.
. Fill in the fields with the information that you have gathered.
. Click *Upload*.

== Result

The dashboard opens. The test suite is listed on the left. Initially, the list item will indicate that the scheduled monitor has not yet run. Also, the *Monitored Endpoints*, *Tests*, and *Schedules* sections will all be empty. However, the monitor is in fact running. After the monitor has run, the list item for the test suite will indicate whether the monitored endpoint passed or failed.


== What to do next

Click the *Scheduling* tab to see the schedule for the monitor. The *Version* column in the table of schedules displays the version number 0.0.1. This number refers to the version of the test suite that you uploaded. If you ever make changes to the test suite and upload it again, the version number will be incremented. For example, the first time that you upload a changed version of the test suite, its version number will be 0.0.2. It will also have a new monitor created for it, which means a new schedule. You can either keep the original schedule for the previous version of the test suite or delete that schedule.

After the monitor runs, click the *Monitored Endpoints* tab to see:

* Whether the endpoint returned the expected code, as indicated by *PASSED* in the first column of the table
* Statistics about the execution of the test of the endpoint

As your monitor continues to run at the scheduled intervals, the statistics in this table are updated. They show the minimum, average, and maximum runtime for up to five executions of the test.

Click *Tests* to see statistics and information pertaining to the monitor. Because you have only one test in the monitor, the statistics and information in this section apply to the test, too. The version number shown here is also 0.0.1. However, if you upload the test suite again after making changes to it, you will see here a second card of information. The version number on this card will be 0.0.2.

Every subsequent version of the test suite that you upload will have its own card and that card will show the version of the test suite. If you delete the schedule for a version of the test suite, the card for that version will no longer appear in the *Tests* section.
