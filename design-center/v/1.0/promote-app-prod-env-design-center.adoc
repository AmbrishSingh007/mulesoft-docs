= To Deploy an App (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When an app that you develop in the design environment is ready to publish, you can deploy it using the procedure in this topic. You need to select an target environment, such as production, that has been set up with vCores for deployment. You deploy an app to a specific environment for a number of reasons:

* Security
+
The environment can be restricted by the organization administrator to certain users.
* Traffic and Server Management
+
You can change the connector configuration 

Deploying an app to a selected environment might give your app public exposure, depending on the setup of the environment.
