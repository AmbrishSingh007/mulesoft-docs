Use this option if you a new to using API Functional Monitoring and do not know how to write tests and use the BAT CLI.


== Before you begin



== About this task
When you create a monitor, you can include only one assertion in the test that the monitor runs at the scheduled times. The only possible assertions are that the tested endpoint must return the expected code.

== Procedure


== Result

The dashboard opens. The monitor is listed on the left. Initially, the list item will indicate that the monitor has not yet run. However, it is in fact running and will indicate whether the monitoring passed or failed after the monitor has run.




== What to do next

Click the *Scheduling* tab to see the schedule for the monitor. You can add additional schedules for the monitor.
