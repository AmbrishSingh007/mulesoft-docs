= API Functional Monitoring in API Monitor

image::early-access-tag.png[]

You can monitor APIs in the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring, which you can access from the home page of Anypoint Platform.

To monitor an API means to monitor the performance of its response to requests that are sent to the resources at its endpoints. The *Functional Monitoring* section contains tools for creating a simple monitor (essentially a test suite that contains a test of one endpoint, running at intervals) and for uploading a test suite (written in the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) test-writing language) and set to run at intervals.

Every schedule that you set for a test suite is referred to as a monitor. Every test suite in the *Functional Monitoring* section is run by at least one monitor. You can create additional monitors for a test suite by creating additional schedules for running it.
