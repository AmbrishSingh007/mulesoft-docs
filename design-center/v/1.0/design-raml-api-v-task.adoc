= To Design a RAML API Specification (Visual Design)

link:/getting-started/api-lifecycle-overview#which-version[_Requires November 2017 Release_]

This procedure is one of four that cover how to design an API with visual editing capabilities of Design Center. 

* To design the RAML Root
* To design a data type
* To design a resource
* To publish to Exchange and test the design

The example API consumes the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`. The oversimplified API just lists the comments the service collects about a particular post. 

To call the API, you enter the implementation URL of the API in a browser and add the ID of a post in the last component of the URL. Comments appear in the browser output.

== To Design the RAML Root

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center. Set up a project to create a new API specification:
+
The branch enters read-only mode if you are idle for 10 minutes. Assuming nobody obtained the lock while you were idle, just click Edit to unlock and continue.
+

+
* In Projects, click Create. Select API Specification.
+
* In New API Specification, type a name for your new project. For example, type *jsonplaceholder*. 
* Select Try API Designer's Visual Editing Capabilities.
+

+
* Click Create.
+
Fields of RAML root properties appear for you to fill in. 
+

+
. In API Summary, set options as follows:
+
* In Title, accept the default or change the API title. For example, change the title to *placeholder*.
* In Version, type a version of the API. For example, *0.1*.
* In Protocols, select HTTP or HTTPS. Select HTTP for this example.
* In Media Type, select the format of the data the API returns. For example, select application/json.
* In Base URI, type the following example URI:
+
`+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{num}/+`
+
{num} is the base URI parameter that represents the ID of a post.
+
. In Description, type a description of API using markdown. For example, type *This API gets the comments about a post given a variable integer post **id** at the end of the URL.*
+
. Click Base URI Parameters.
+
image::add-base-uri-parameter.png[height=106,width=401]
+
. Define the Num base URI parameter: 
+
* Click Add Base URI Parameter.
+
Base URI Parameter Name and Type fields appear.
+
* In Base URI Parameter Name, type an arbitrary name. For example: *Num*. 
* In Type, select a RAML scalar type. For example, select Integer.
* In Base URI Parameters, click Details >.
+
image::baseuri-details.png[height=67,width=387]
+
Fill in the fields to define RAML facets that restrict what you can substitute for {num} in the URI. For example:
+
** In Description, describe the Num property. For example, *The number of stored comments in posts.*
** Change the default Required setting to unchecked. You do not want to require the user of the API to enter a parameter value. Instead, you will define a default in the event a parameter isn't entered.
** In Minimum and Maximum, enter input range limits. For example, type *1* and *5*, respectively. To call the API, the parameter {num} must be a number between 1-5.
** In Format, select a value. For example, select int.
** In Example number, enter *3*.
** In Default Number, enter *1*.
** Accept the other defaults.
+
The generated RAML code appears on the right.
