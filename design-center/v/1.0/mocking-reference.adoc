= Simulating Calls to the API (Mocking) Reference

Simulating calls to the API is a critical design task that helps you troubleshoot problems and demo the API to prospective users even before you have implemented it. Valuable feedback can result from a demo and help you improve the API. To simulate calls to the API, you include example responses. A response can consist of the following things:

* HTTP status codes the API returns on success or failure
* An example of data that the API returns on success

You use the mocking service in Design Center to provide a base URI for the unimplemented API. The mocking service reacts to HTTP requests by returning responses based on your RAML design. In the RAML, you include HTTP responses for simulating the API. For example:

----
responses:
      200:
        body:
----

In body, you define an example, as described in the topic To Simulate Calling an API (Mocking). The example is typically a snippet of the data you'd expect to get from calling the method of this resource. 

Ideally, when you design the API, you include responses for other common HTTP status codes: 400, 401, 404, 405, 406, and 415.

In API Summary, you can make an actual (not simulated) call the API under the following conditions:

* You implemented the API and users can access the REST service.
* You provided the working URI in the baseURI RAML property

Otherwise, you can simulate a call to the API using the mocking service.

Before you turn on the mocking service to simulate calling the API, the API uses the baseURI value you specified, if any, in the RAML design. In the example, the baseURI is `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.

After you turn on the mocking service, the mocking service creates a basic implementation of your API and exposes a real service based on it. The mocking service modifies the baseUri in the RAML. 

----
#%RAML 1.0

version: 1.0
baseUri: https://mocksvc.mulesoft.com/mocks/d0422e05-e779-4016-9d9e-027e50cd15a7 
# baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
----

The mocking service URI goes into effect. This URI is a proxy that prevents the simulation from getting blocked by a same-origin restriction policy.

When you make a successful call to the API the mocking service returns the status code 200 and example contained in your RAML code. If you omit the example snippet of data when designing the RAML, the following actions occur:

* The mocking service trys to resolve the request.
* The mocking service returns a status 200 and a message that says the RAML had no response information.

To call the mocking service, you can use any one of the following tools to simulate calling the API:

* API Designer
+
Use the controls in API Summary, following the steps in the topic To Simulate Calling an API. 
* An HTTP client, such as Postman
* The curl command 

As shown in the last step of the topic To Simulate Calling a RAML API (Mocking), you can uaw query parameters in the simulated call if your designed your API to support query parameters. If the parameter you enter when calling the API doesn't match the specifications of your design, the mocking service returns an error to indicate an invalid parameter.
