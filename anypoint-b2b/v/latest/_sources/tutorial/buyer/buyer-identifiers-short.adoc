// Buyer Identifiers (short)

After you have changed the partner you are configuring from the Buyer (AAZFasteners) to the Supplier (AcmeHomeSupply), the procedure for adding Supplier Identifiers is the same as for adding Buyer Identifiers; only the configuration details are different.

Thus, to add an X12-ISA Identifier for the Buyer, perform <<Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier>>, substituting for *Acme* *AAZ* in the *Interchange ID (ISA)* value in the corresponding step.

To add an AS2 Identifier, perform <<Add Buyer AS2 Identifier>>, substituting  *buyer* for *supplier* for the *AS2 Identity* value in the corresponding step.
