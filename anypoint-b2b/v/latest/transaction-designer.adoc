= Transaction Designer

Transaction Designer is an APM feature that enables you to design the _elements_ of a transaction. These transaction elements include:

* Document Types
* Endpoints
* Channels
* Maps


Transaction Designer enables you to configure these elements from a central page that shows the elements along with their completion status, and what steps may remain in order to complete them. To see how to use this feature to create a transaction that receives a Purchase Order, see  link:/anypoint-b2b/apm-tutorial-td[Anypoint Partner Manager Tutorial: Designing a Transaction]

* <<Design a New Transaction>>
* <<Start Designing a New Transacion from a Template>>
* <<Create a New Transaction Design Template>>

== Design a New Transaction

Choosing this method of designing a transaction gives you complete control over the channels, documents, endpoints, and maps that make up the transaction. However, you also have to make the choices required to create those elements.

== Start Designing a New Transaction from a Template

When you start designing a new transaction from an existing template, the elements created when that template was created (and subsequently modified, if applicable) are available to you. For example, you could use the template created in link:/anypoint-b2b/apm-tutorial-td[Anypoint Partner Manager Tutorial: Designing a Transaction] for as template for purchase orders for partners other than Acme Home Supply (the partner in the tutorial).

== Create a New Transaction Design Template

Choosing this option means that you want to create a template for future use by people who want to <<Start Designing a New Transacion from a Template>>. For example, you might want to create a template for receiving a Purchase Order from a customer. The process of creating such a template is documented in link:/anypoint-b2b/apm-tutorial-td[Anypoint Partner Manager Tutorial: Designing a Transaction].
