= Anypoint Partner Manager Basic Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates the role Anypoint Partner Manager Framework (APMF) plays in B2B transaction processing. APMF consists of two components:

* Anypoint Partner Manager (AP)
* Anypoint Partner Manager Routing Engine

The tutorial provides instructions for configuring APMF so that you can simulate a transaction and see how APMF processes it.

In the tutorial, you will:

* <<Configure Anypoint Partner Manager>>
* <<Install APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>
* <<Download and Configure the Partner Simulator>>
* <<Start the Application>>
* <<Start the Transaction>>
* <<Monitor the Transaction>>

== Before You Begin

Verify that you have the following:

* Anypoint Platform user account with APM access
+
NOTE: If you are unable to access APM, see your Mulesoft account administrator for assistance.

* Anypoint Studio with Mule 3.8.4 and the following connectors:
** Anypoint Partner Manager 6.4.1
** AS2 v2.1.0
** FTPS v2.0.0
** X12 v1.2.2
** Object Store v2.1.0
** Amazon SQS v4.1.0

== Configure Anypoint Partner Manager

In this section, you will:

* <<Configure the Supplier>>
* <<Design the Transaction>>
* <<Copy your Environment ID>>
* <<Identify or Create an API Key>>.

=== Configure the Supplier

The Supplier, as shown in the images that follow, is *AAZFasteners*, a fictional manufacturer of nuts and bolts, also identified on the xref:img-partner-configuration[] as *YOUR COMPANY*.

For *AAZFasteners*, you will:

* <<Select the Partner to be Configured>>
* Add <<Identifiers>>
* <<Upload a Certificate>>
* <<Configure Document Types>>
* <<Configure Endpoints>>
* <<Configure Channels>>


==== Select the Partner to be Configured

In your copy of APM, this partner will likely have been configured by your system administrator, and will likely have a different name, but it will still be identified as *YOUR COMPANY*.

===== To Select the Partner

. link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager#start-anypoint-manager[Start APM].
The <<anypoint-partner-manager.adoc#img-apm-start,Transaction Monitoring Page>> appears.
. In the left-hand navigation pane, click *Partner Configuration*.
The xref:img-partner-configuration[] appears.
+
[[img-partner-configuration]]
image::partner-configuration.png[img-partner-configuration,title="Partner Configuration Page"]

The other partner in this walkthrough is the _Buyer_. In the next section, we create this partner, identifying it as *AcmeHomeSupply*.
In the tutorial, AcmeHomeSupply uses APM to order products from AAZFasteners.

After you create *AcmeHomeSupply*, you will <<Add Buyer Identifiers>>.

==== Create the Buyer Partner

. In the *CONFIGURATION* section of the left-hand navigation pane on the xref:img-channels[] (or any other APM Configuration page), in the left-hand navigation pane, click *^&larr;^ Partners*.
+
The xref:img-partner-configuration[] appears..
+
. On xref:img-partner-configuration[], Click *Create New Partner*.
The xref:img-company-information[] appears.
+
[[img-company-information]]
image::company-information.png[img-company-information,title="Company Information Page"]

. On the xref:img-company-information[], in the *Company Name* box, type *AcmeHomeSupply*.
. Click *Save*.
+
The xref:img-partner-configuration[] appears, displaying both *AAZFasteners* and *AcmeHomeSupply*.
+
NOTE: As previously mentioned, in your copy of APM, *YOUR COMPANY* is probably not named *AAZFasteners*. However, for illustration purposes, we refer to *YOUR COMPANY* as *AAZFasteners* throughout this tutorial.



==== Identifiers

_Identifiers_ are values, communicated in messages, that can be used to uniquely identify a specific partner. Some identifiers are defined by standards bodies, such as _DUNS numbers_, which are assigned by Dun and Bradstreet. Others are mutually defined between partners. AS2 uses identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of a transmission. X12 and EDIFACT use identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of an EDI document.

For these partners, we use two identifiers:

* X12-ISA
* AS2

==== Add Buyer Identifiers

After you have changed the partner you are configuring from the Supplier (AAZFasteners) to the Buyer (AcmeHomeSupply), the procedure for adding Buyer Identifiers is the same as for adding Supplier Identifiers; only the configuration details are different.

Thus, to add an X12-ISA Identifier for the Buyer, perform <<Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier>>, substituting *Acme* for *AAZ* for the *Interchange ID (ISA)* value in the corresponding step.

To add an AS2 Identifier, perform <<Add Supplier AS2 Identifier>>, substituting *Acme* for *AAZ* for the *AS2 Identity* value in the corresponding step.

===== Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier


. On the xref:img-partner-configuration[], click *AAZFasteners*.
+
The xref:img-company-information-aaz[] appears.

[[img-company-information-aaz, Company Information Page for AAZFasteners]]

[start=3]

. On the <<img-identifiers>>, click *New*.
+
The <<img-identifier-new>> appears.

[[img-identifier-new, New Identifier Page]]

image::identifier-new.png[img-identifier-new, title="New Identifier Page"]

[start=3]

. In the *Type* box, click the down-arrow.
+
The list of types appears.
. From the list, select *X12-ISA*.

+
A list of qualifiers appears.
. *AAZFasteners* and *AcmeHomeSupply* do not use standards-based identifiers, so *ZZ (Mutually Defined)* is the appropriate choice.
. In the *Interchange ID (ISA)* box, type *AAZ*.
+

. Click *Save* to save the new identifier.
+
The <<img-identifiers-x12>> appears.


[[img-identifiers-x12, Identifiers Page (X12 Identifier Added)]]

==== Upload Certificates

APM uses certificates to...

===== Upload a Certificate

. On the <<img-identifiers>>, in the left-hand navigation pane, in the *PARTNERS* section, click *Certificate*.
+
The xref:img-certificate[] appears.

[[img-certificate, Certificate Page]]

+
*<file>* appears in the Certificate box.
. Click *Upload Certificate*.
+
The xref:img-certificate[] refreshes, displaying details of the uploaded certificate.

==== Configure Document Types

The terms  _document_, _file_, and _message_ are used interchangeably in the B2B world to reflect an instance of a structured payload being passed through a system to convey information about a transaction. For consistency, we use the term document to represent these instances.

APM enables you to categorize and configure specific _Document Types_.

==== Configure the Target Document Type

. On the <<img-certificates>> in the left-hand navigation pane, in the *PARTNERS* section, click *Document Types*.

=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an link:/anypoint-b2b/glossary#secta[API Key] and an .

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use APM to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master link:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see link:/anypoint-b2b/administration#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].
