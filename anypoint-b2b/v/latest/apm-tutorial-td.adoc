= Anypoint Partner Manager Basic Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates the role Anypoint Partner Manager Framework (APMF) plays in B2B transaction processing. APMF consists of two components:

* Anypoint Partner Manager (AP)
* Anypoint Partner Manager Routing Engine

The tutorial provides instructions for configuring APMF so that you can simulate a transaction and see how APMF processes it.

In the tutorial, you will:

* <<Configure a Supplier>>
* <<Design a Target Channel>>
* <<Configure a Buyer>>
* <<Design a Source Channel>>
* <<Configure an S3 Bucket (optional)>>
* <<Copy APM Information>>
* <<Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>
* <<Start the Applications>>
* <<Send a Message>>
* <<Monitor the Transaction>>


== Before You Begin

Verify that you have the following:

* Anypoint Platform user account with APM access
+
NOTE: If you are unable to access APM, see your Mulesoft account administrator for assistance.

* Anypoint Studio with Mule 3.8.4 and the following connectors:
** AS2 v2.1.0
** FTPS v2.0.0
** EDIFACT EDI
** RosettaNet
** X12 v1.2.2
** Object Store v2.1.0
** Amazon SQS v4.1.0 (optional)

== Configure a Supplier

This tutorial works with two partners: a Supplier and a Buyer.

The Supplier is *AAZFasteners*, a fictional retailer of nuts and bolts, also identified on the xref:img-partner-configuration[] as *YOUR COMPANY*.

NOTE: In your copy of APM, *YOUR COMPANY* is probably not named *AAZFasteners*. However, for illustration purposes, we refer to *YOUR COMPANY* as *AAZFasteners* throughout this tutorial. If you want to change the name of *Your Company* to *AAZFasteners*, see link:/anypoint-b2b/partner-configuration#create-and-configure-partners[Create and Configure Partners]. However, the tutorial will work without making the change.

The other partner in this tutorial is the _Buyer_, a fictional retailer of home supplies. In <<Create the Buyer Partner>>, we create this partner, identifying it as *AcmeHomeSupply*.
In the tutorial, AcmeHomeSupply uses APM to order products from AAZFasteners. In the following sections, you will:

* <<Add Identifiers>>

* <<Upload Certificates>>

=== Add Identifiers

_Identifiers_ are values, communicated in messages, that can be used to uniquely identify a specific partner. Some identifiers are defined by standards bodies, such as _DUNS numbers_, which are assigned by Dun and Bradstreet. Others are mutually defined between partners. AS2 uses identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of a transmission. X12 and EDIFACT use identifiers to identify the sender and receiver of an EDI document.

For these partners, we use two identifiers:

* X12-ISA
* AS2

In the following sections, we add identifiers for the supplier. We will add buyer identifers in <<Create the Buyer Identifiers>>.

==== Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/identifier-x12-isa-supplier.adoc[]

==== Add Supplier AS2 Identifier

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/identifier-as2-supplier.adoc[]

=== Upload Certificates

APM uses certificates to...

==== Upload the Supplier Certificate

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/certificate-supplier.adoc[]


== Design a Target Channel 

==== Start Transaction Designer

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/start-td-aaz.adoc[]

=== Create the Target Channel

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/td-target-channel-aaz.adoc[]


=== Create the Source Document Type for the Target Channel

The terms  _document_, _file_, and _message_ are used interchangeably in the B2B world to reflect an instance of a structured payload being passed through a system to convey information about a transaction. For consistency, we use the term document to represent these instances.

APM enables you to categorize and configure specific _Document Types_.

==== To Create the Target Document Type for the Source Channel

include::_sources/tutorial/supplier/td-target-channel-source-doc-aaz.adoc[]


=== Configure Endpoints

An _endpoint_ is the entry point to a service, a process, or a queue or topic destination in service-oriented architecture.
In APM, an endpoint defines the protocol, address, and other details specific to an exchange of messages between partners.

==== Configure the Target Endpoint

== Configure a Buyer

=== Create the Buyer Partner

include::_sources/tutorial/buyer/create-buyer-partner.adoc[]


=== Add Buyer Identifiers

NOTE: Make sure you are configuring *AcmeHomeSupply*, not *AAZFasteners*.

==== Add Buyer X12-ISA Identifier

To add this identifier, perform steps in <<Add Supplier X12-ISA Identifier>>,
substituting *Acme* for *AAZ*.

==== Add Buyer AS2 Identifier

To add this identifier, perform steps in <<Add Supplier XS2 Identifier>>,
substituting *Buyer* for *Supplier*.

=== Upload the Buyer Certificate

To add the certificate, perform steps in <<Upload the Supplier Certificate>>,
substituting *partner.cer* for *HomeOrg.p12*.


=== Create the Buyer Send Endpoint

== Configure an S3 Bucket (optional)

Configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket enables you to view message payloads in <<Monitor the Transaction>>. You will add configuration data from the bucket in <<Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>.

== Copy APM Information

=== Copy your Environment ID

. On the <<anypoint-partner-manager.adoc#img-apm-start,B2B Transactions Page>>, in the left-hand navigation pane, click *Administration*, then click *Environments*.
. In the row that corresponds to the environment with which you are working, click *copy*.


=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an link:/anypoint-b2b/glossary#secta[API Key] and an .

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use APM to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master link:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see link:/anypoint-b2b/administration#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].


== Configure APM Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio

For information about using Anypoint Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/[Anypoint Studio].

The xref:img-transaction-monitoring-tutorial[] should confirm that:

* An XML purchase order was read from the company's filesystem and transformed to an X12 850 document.
* The 850 was sent to a supplier over AS2.
* The link:/anypoint-b2b/as2-connector[AS2 Connector]
 listened for (on an AS2 endpoint) and received an X12 997 document that identifies whether the 850 was accepted or rejected.
