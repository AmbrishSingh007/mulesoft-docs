= Monitoring Center

IN PROGRESS - INFO DUMP AT THIS POINT...

Understanding the state of your infrastructure and systems is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of your services. As part of Anypoint Platform, the Monitoring Center provides visibility into APIs and integrations across an application network. The monitoring tools are uniquely capable of providing feedback from Mule flows and components in your app network.

//It uses data access capabilities, context, and data in the APIs and Integrations platform to provide best-in-the-industry Monitoring and Diagnostics.

Operations and development teams use the monitoring tools to diagnose issues and prescribe solutions to behavior that negatively impacts digital performance. The monitoring tools are designed to reduce the time to identify and resolve these issues through aggregated metrics, data visualization tools, alerts for issues, and a log aggregator system. Specifically, the Monitoring Center provides ways to:

* Aggregate and map metrics across dependent systems in real-time.
* Configure dashboards and alerts to reduce the mean time to identification
of issues (MTTI).
* Store and search log data at scale.

// Free and Premium features
// Integrations with Splunk/ELK and monitoring tools such as Nagio, and MS Ops

== Dashboards

Built-in and custom dashboards expose the metrics relevant to your app network. They provide visual representations of your resources so you can see trends that are not normally obvious in raw form, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.

//the different topologies of your systems.

A custom dashboard provides a single screen that can bring together specific metrics and data points that are important to your organization.

* System-wide metrics dashboards/reports
* Dashboards - Custom Dashboard (specific metrics and data points), Built-in Dashboards (out-of-the box metrics monitoring)
  ** Dashboards expose Metrics "relevant to different topologies of user systems"?
////

== Event-Driven Alerts

//Track trends and add your own alerts to identify abnormal behavior and problems in your application network.

Alerting allows you to define different rules (or thresholds) and policies for different resources. When these thresholds are crossed for a certain period of time, you can receive notification to take action. The method of notification depends on the severity of the alert that you define.

== Customizable Dashboards

Use built-in dashboards or customize your own to provide visibility into the performance of your apps and detailed analysis of your network.

The example shows the System API and Experience API separated by failed and successful requests. Teams can build unified dashboards across an unlimited number of components, fully customizing charts and graphs, exporting data into their favorite format and tools.

You can track numerous data points/metrics from a custom dashboard that looks across multiple services in the app and in your dashboards across all systems (whether they are runtime, runtime services, integrations, APIs).

== Logging System

The Monitoring Center facilitates distributed log searches of raw log and event data from across the app network so that you can pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

The log aggregator system holds raw operational data and records events that occur in the operating system or Mule app. Log aggregation compiles, organizes, and indexes log files to facilitate management, searching, and analysis. Aggregated logs compliment the monitoring system by helping you identify causes of operational issues and investigate failures.

== Dependency Mapping

Identify and document the health of every consecutive component within an app in your network. Diagnose and prescribe solutions to broken components.


== API Functional Monitoring

Create tests to actively test and exercise the APIs to fully monitor them in production to identify issues before they arise.

For CIO leadership that oversees key performance indicators (KPIs), you can use it to provide rollup reports with system-wide metrics dashboards and reports.

For Java developers, alerts provide information on the status of production systems. The Monitoring System also provides automatic metric and log instrumentation, customizable monitoring dashboards, and distributed log search.

Systems Administrators, who manage and maintain infrastructure systems in production, can monitor and receive alerts on status of production systems.

Create and operate effective processes for repeatedly servicing infrastructure and organizational needs
Automatic metric and log instrumentation

Customizable monitoring dashboards

The Monitoring Center if for system administrators and developers (who need to monitor and receive alerts on up-time, and dive in to fix problems in production) to senior users such as line-of-business (LoB) owners and VPs who want to see distilled monitoring reports to track progress and KPIs.
