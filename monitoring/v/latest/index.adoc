= Anypoint Monitoring

Understanding the state of your infrastructure and systems is important for ensuring the reliability and stability of your services. As part of Anypoint Platform, Anypoint Monitoring provides visibility into integrations across your app network. The monitoring tools provide feedback from Mule flows and components in your app network.

// TODO: REMOVED ALL REFS TO APIS
//It uses data access capabilities, context, and data in the APIs and Integrations platform to provide best-in-the-industry Monitoring and Diagnostics.

Operations and development teams use the monitoring tools to diagnose issues and prescribe solutions to behavior that negatively impacts digital performance. The monitoring tools are designed to reduce the time to identify and resolve these issues through aggregated metrics, data visualization tools, alerts for issues, and a log aggregation system. Specifically, Anypoint Monitoring provides ways to:

* Aggregate and map metrics across dependent systems in real-time.
* Configure dashboards and alerts to reduce the mean time to identification
of issues (MTTI).
* Store and search log data at scale.

//TODO: PERFORMANCE?
//What is the performance overhead?3-5% maximum CPU utilization impact.  1% in current testing (internal onlyfor this number).

// TODO: Free and Premium features
// Integrations with Splunk/ELK and monitoring tools such as Nagio, and MS Ops

== Dashboards

Use built-in dashboards or customize your own to provide instant visibility into your applications' performance and detailed analysis of your network.

Built-in and custom dashboards expose the metrics on your app network. They provide visual representations of your resources so you can detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and see trends that are not obvious in raw form.

//the different topologies of your systems.

A custom dashboard provides a single screen that can bring together specific metrics and data points that are important to your organization. Custom dashboards can display graphs and other charts, such as single statistics.

//The example includes system data separated by failed and successful requests. You can build unified dashboards across an unlimited number of components, fully customizing charts and graphs, exporting data into a selected format and tools.

You can track numerous data points/metrics from a custom dashboard that looks across multiple services in the app and in your dashboards across all systems.

See link:dashboards-using[Dashboards].

== Event-Driven Alerts

Track trends and add your own alerts to identify abnormal behavior and problems in your application network.

image::alert-infographic.png[Alerts]

You can trigger alerts based on rules (or thresholds) and policies for your resources. When these thresholds are crossed for a certain period of time, you can receive notification to take action. The method of notification depends on the severity of the alert that you define.

See link:alerts[Alerts].

== Logging System

Search across log files, including archived logs to find information and events based on a specific query.

image::logs-infographic.png[Logs]

Anypoint Monitoring facilitates distributed log searches of raw log and event data from across the app network so that you can pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

The log aggregator system holds raw operational data and records events that occur in the operating system or Mule app. Log aggregation compiles, organizes, and indexes log files to facilitate management, searching, and analysis. Aggregated logs compliment the monitoring system by helping you identify causes of operational issues and investigate failures.
