= Monitoring Center

IN PROGRESS - INFO DUMP AT THIS POINT

The Monitoring Center provides end-to-end, actionable visibility into APIs and integrations. It helps operations and development teams diagnose issues and prescribe solutions to behavior that negatively impacts digital performance. The monitoring tools are designed to reduce the time to identify and resolve these issues.

The Monitoring Center provides ways to:

* Aggregate and maps metrics across dependent systems in real-time.
* Configure dashboards and alerts to reduce mean time to identification (MTTI).
* Store and search log data at scale.

== Event-driven Alerts

Track trends and add your own alerts to identify abnormal behavior and problems in your application network.

== Customizable Dashboards

Use built-in dashboards or customize your own to provide visibility into the performance of your apps and detailed analysis of your network.

The example shows the System API and Experience API separated by failed and successful requests. Teams can build unified dashboards across an unlimited number of components, fully customizing charts and graphs, exporting data into their favorite format and tools.

You can track numerous data points/metrics from a custom dashboard that looks across multiple services in the app and in your dashboards across all systems (whether they are runtime, runtime services, integrations, APIs).

== Dependency Mapping

Identify and document the health of every consecutive component within an app in your network. Diagnose and prescribe solutions to broken components.

== Distributed Log Search

Search raw log and event data from across the application network to pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

== API Functional Monitoring

Create tests to actively test and exercise the APIs to fully monitor them in production to identify issues before they arise.

For CIO leadership that oversees key performance indicators (KPIs), you can use it to provide rollup reports with system-wide metrics dashboards and reports.

For Java developers, alerts provide information on the status of production systems. The Monitoring System also provides automatic metric and log instrumentation, customizable monitoring dashboards, and distributed log search.

Systems Administrators, who manage and maintain infrastructure systems in production, can monitor and receive alerts on status of production systems.

A single web or mobile transaction crosses an average of 35 different technology systems or components. This complexity introduces a range of challenges:

* Gaps in observability
* Increased time to identification
* Increased time to resolution
* Poor customer experience
* Lost revenue
