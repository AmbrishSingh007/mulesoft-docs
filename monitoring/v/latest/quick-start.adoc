= Getting Started

Anypoint Monitoring is part of the Management Center in Anypoint Platform.


== Supported Platform and Mule Version

For Anypoint Monitoring to start monitoring your Mule apps, you must deploy them to the appropriate version of Mule runtime.

|===
| Platform | Mule Version

| Anypoint Platform (CloudHub)
a| Apps running on Mule Runtime

* 3.9.0-AM
* 3.9.1-AM
* 4.1.1-AM
|===

== Updating an Existing App

To update an existing app with the latest image, simply go to Settings in
Runtime Manager for that App, and choose the new Runtime from the Runtime Version selector.

For new apps, select the appropriate version in the deployment UI.

If you are using the Anypoint CLI to deploy your applications, for example,
through a build pipeline, be sure to include the `--runtime` parameter with
an appropriate value, for example:

````
anypoint-cli --username="..." --password="..." --organization="Mythical, Inc" --environment="Production" runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy --runtime="3.9.0-AM" helloworld ~/demoproj2.zip
````

//REMOVED PER PABLO GALIANO & SEBASTIAN:
//For Mule apps running on older versions of the runtime, Anypoint Monitoring will provide information from Runtime Manager, API Manager, and API Analytics.
