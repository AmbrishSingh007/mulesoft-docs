== General Settings

General settings include basic and advanced options for configuring time-series data. Both configuration share fields for the title and a short description.

.Basic and Advanced Mode Settings

| Title | Title to display in the UI. Defaults to Panel Title.
| Description | Short description to display in the UI when users hover over the information (`i`) icon.

*TODO: VERIFY:* It can contain Markdown and links. If true, SHOW EXs WITH MARKDOWN AND LINKS

Other settings are specific to the setting mode (basic or advanced).

=== Basic Settings

Basic settings in the General tab support the display of a single metric for a resource in a given environment.

.Basic Mode

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| Metric a|

* CPU
* Heap Usage
* Response Time By App
* Response Time By Inbound Endpoint
* Response Time By Outbound Endpoint
* Messages Processed
| Environment | Your Mule app environments.
| Resource | The Mule app.

*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME OF THE ABOVE SETTINGS*

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration _without saving_ and return to the dashboard, simply click the `X`.

=== Advanced Settings

Advanced settings in the General tab support one or more fine-tuned queries for your chart.

It is important to note that an advanced configuration will be partially removed if you switch back to the basic configuration area.

.Advanced Mode

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| From a|

Lists JVM and Mule app properties (such as `jvm.memory` and `app_inbound_metric`) that you can add to your chart.

Note that the field provides matching suggestions when you type in a character. For example, `jvm.c` will produce a list of all values that contain those characters (such as `jvm.classloading` and `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`).
| Where a|
Supports conditional logic for filtering the From data source you selected.

* You can select one or more filters tags (such as `app_id`, `env_id`, `org_id`, `worker_id`). Example: `Where env_id = Sandbox`.
* Available operators include `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, and `>`.
* You can also construct a query that contains multiple filtering expressions by using logical `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions.
| Select a|
For creating a function that selects a field (such as  `heap_committed`,`heap_total`, or `heap_used`) from you From data (such as `jvm.memory`) and applies an operation to it (such as the `mean` of the `heap_total`). You can add one or more `field` settings.

*TODO: VERIFY* Note that when you group by time, you need to use an aggregation function. In addition, some functions like derivatives also require an aggregation function.
| Group By a|

*TODO* For grouping the data by a selected time interval (such as `$__interval`, `1s`, `10m`, `1h`), filter tag (such as `tag(env_id)`), and fill options (such as `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`).

Valid values with any available arguments separated by `\|` pipes:

* `time($__interval)` where valid interval values are  `1s`, `10s`, `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `1h`.
* `fill()` where valid values are `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`.
* `LIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to limit the result to the first N data  points (combined series and timestamp values) returned by a query.
* `SLIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to return the all data points (combined series and timestamp values) from the first N series returned by the query.
* `ORDER BY time DESC`: Returns results in descending time order.
| Alias By | *TODO* Example: `$tag_worker_id`. Note that the `$tag_` prefix can be used to alias for a tag, such as `worker_id` or `env_id`, when you are grouping by that tag.

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration _without saving_ and return to the dashboard, simply click the `X`.

TODO /QUESTION: CAN YOU DO Regex matching ON WHERE?
TODO / SELECT:  row you can specify what fields and functions you want to use. If you have a group by time you need an aggregation function. Some functions like derivative require an aggregation function. The editor tries simplify and unify this part of the query. For example:
*TODO: DESCRIPTIONS NEEDED*: Group By.
*TODO: VALID VALUES NEEDED, explain supported variables, too. MK's notes say "Series Name"*
*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OF THESE SETTINGS*

TODO: SEE IF ANY OF THIS COULD GO ABOVE:
.Advanced Query Options
|===
| From | Identifies the source of the data to measure in your graph. For example, you might select Mule app (`app`) or Java virtual machine (`jvm`) data, such as `app_inbound_metric`, `app_outbound_metric`, `jvm.classloading`, `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`, `jvm.garbagecollector.parnew`, `jvm.memory`, `jvm.runtime`, `jvm.threading`, or one of the many other sources.
| Where | For filtering the source based on a given property (such as the organization ID (`org_id`) or environment ID (`env_id`), or both) to which the metric applies. Operators for the properties are `=`, `!=`, `<>` (less than or greater than, but not equal to), `<`, `>` (for example, `env_id = Sandbox`). Available properties also include `app_id`, `endpoint`, `endpoint_type`, `flow_id`, `org_id`, `response_type`, and `worker_id`.
| Select | For manipulating data in one or more fields, such as `avg_request_count` , `avg_response_time`.
