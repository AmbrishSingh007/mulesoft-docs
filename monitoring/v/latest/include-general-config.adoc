== General Settings

General settings include basic and advanced options for configuring time-series data. Both configuration share fields for the title and a short description.

.Basic and Advanced Mode Settings

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Title | Title to display in the UI. Defaults to Panel Title.
| Description | Short description to display in the UI when users hover over the information (`i`) icon. *TODO: VERIFY:* It can contain Markdown and links.
|===
//TODO: SHOW ME WITH MARKDOWN AND LINKS

Other settings are specific to the setting mode (basic or advanced).

=== Basic Settings

Basic settings in the General tab support the display of a single metric for a resource in a given environment.

.Basic Mode

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| Metric a|

* CPU
* Heap Usage
* Response Time By App
* Response Time By Inbound Endpoint
* Response Time By Outbound Endpoint
* Messages Processed
| Environment | Your Mule app environments.
| Resource | The Mule app.
|===

//*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME OF THE ABOVE SETTINGS*

After you complete your configuration, you can either click Save Changes or exit the configuration _without saving_ and return to the dashboard by clicking the `X`.

=== Advanced Singlestat Settings

Advanced settings in the General tab support one or more fine-tuned queries for your chart.

It is important to note that an advanced configuration will be partially removed if you switch back to the basic configuration area.

.Advanced Mode

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| From | Lists JVM and Mule app properties (such as `jvm.memory` and `app_inbound_metric`) that you can add to your graph or singlestat.
| Where | Supports conditional logic for filtering your data set. You can select one or more filters tags (such as `app_id`, `env_id`, `org_id`, `worker_id`). Example: `Where env_id = Sandbox`. Available operators include `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, and `>`. You can also construct a query with multiple filter tags by using  logical `AND` and `OR` operators.
| Select a|
For creating a function that selects a field (such as `heap_committed`,`heap_total`, or `heap_used`) from a From property (such as `jvm.memory`) and applies an operation to it (such as the `mean` of the `heap_total`). You can add one or more `field` settings.

image::config-general-advanced-select.png[Select Options]
| Group By | For grouping the data by a selected time interval (such as `$__interval`, `1s`, `10m`, `1h`), filter tag (such as `tag(env_id)`), and fill options (such as `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`). In addition to filter tags, you can also choose `LIMIT`, `SLIMIT`, `ORDER BY time DESC`. *TODO: DESCRIPTIONS NEEDED*
| Alias By | *TODO: VALID VALUES NEEDED, explain supported variables, too. MK's notes say "Series Name"*  Example: `$tag_worker_id`
|===

//*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OF THESE SETTINGS*

After you complete your configuration, you can either click Save Changes or exit the configuration _without saving_ and return to the dashboard by clicking the `X`.

== Add Series: Basic Mode

== Add Series: Advanced Mode

You can configure one or more detailed queries for time-series data.

.Advanced Query Options
|===
| From | Identifies the source of the data to measure in your graph. For example, you might select Mule app (`app`) or Java virtual machine (`jvm`) data, such as `app_inbound_metric`, `app_outbound_metric`, `jvm.classloading`, `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`, `jvm.garbagecollector.parnew`, `jvm.memory`, `jvm.runtime`, `jvm.threading`, or one of the many other sources.
| Where | For filtering the source based on a given property (such as the organization ID (`org_id`) or environment ID (`env_id`), or both) to which the metric applies. Operators for the properties are `=`, `!=`, `<>` (less than or greater than, but not equal to), `<`, `>` (for example, `env_id = Sandbox`). Available properties also include `app_id`, `endpoint`, `endpoint_type`, `flow_id`, `org_id`, `response_type`, and `worker_id`.
| Select | For manipulating data in one or more fields, such as `avg_request_count` , `avg_response_time`.
