= Using Logs

The Monitoring Center aggregates your log files so you can manage, search for, filter, and analyze your logs. You can use aggregated logs in conjunction with monitoring to help identify causes and investigate failures quickly.

=== Searching Logs

You can search for text in logs in a couple of ways:

* Typing your search query into the search field.
+
You can provide full terms, such as `"code 400"` to find  bad requests. For exact matches to multi-worded searches, you need to surround your search terms in quotation marks. Here are results from a `"code 400"` search:

You can also provide wildcards such as `payload=org.glassfish.grizzly*`. Here are the results of that search:
