= Configuring Alerts

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can set up alerts that trigger when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) exceeds a specified threshold. You set up an alert through an Alerts configuration tab for a graph in a custom dashboard.

The next section shows the settings that are specific to alerts.
