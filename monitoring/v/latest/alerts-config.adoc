= Configuring Alerts

You can configure several types of alerts:

* Operational alerts for APIs through API Manager
* Operational alerts the runtime through Runtime Manager
* Alerts for graphs in custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring

== Setting Up API and Runtime Alerts

From Alerts in Anypoint Monitoring, you can use Add Alerts to link out to configuration pages for API and Runtime alerts. You can also get basic instructions for configuring alerts for a chart (widget) in a custom dashboard.

== Setting up Alerts in Runtime Manager

For guidance with alerts in Runtime Manager, see link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[About Configuring Alerts using Runtime Manager]

== Setting up Alerts in API Manager

For guidance with alerts in API Manager, see link:/api-manager/v/2.x/using-api-alerts[About API Alerts].

== Setting up Alerts for Graphs in Custom Dashboards

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can set up alerts to trigger email notifications when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) exceeds a specified threshold.

You can create alerts through an Alerts configuration tab for any graph in a custom dashboard.
