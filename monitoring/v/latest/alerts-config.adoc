= Configuring Alerts

In Anypoint Monitoring, you set up alerts to trigger and email alert notifications when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) exceeds a specified threshold. You can create alerts through an Alerts configuration tab for any graph in a custom dashboard.

The next section shows the settings that are specific to alerts.
