= Configuring Alerts

You can configure several types of alerts:

* Operational alerts for APIs through API Manager
* Operational alerts the runtime through Runtime Manager
* Alerts for graphs in custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring:
+
Thresholds are checked every 5 minutes. The evaluated query is the average value of the metric in the last 5 minutes. The evaluated metric is the one referenced in the General tab for the chart. If the value is above the threshold the alert is triggered. The alert is triggered only if the alert state changes (from OK state to Alerting state or vice versa).

== Setting Up API and Runtime Alerts

From Alerts in Anypoint Monitoring, you can link out to configuration pages for API and Runtime alerts.

* API Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in API Manager, see link:/api-manager/v/2.x/using-api-alerts[About API Alerts].
* Runtime Operational Alerts: For guidance with alerts in Runtime Manager, see link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[About Configuring Alerts using Runtime Manager]

== Setting up Alerts for Graphs in Custom Dashboards

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can set up alerts to trigger email notifications when a data point you are measuring (`JVM - CPU % Utilization`) exceeds a specified threshold.

== Adding Alerts

Once alerts are listed on your Alerts page, you can use Add Alerts to link out to API and Runtime Alert configuration pages. You can also get basic instructions for configuring alerts for a chart (widget) in a custom dashboard.

=== Enabling and Disabling Alerts

You can activate or deactivate an alert by toggling the link:alerts[knob on the right]. Enabling a disabled alert causes the alert to transition to the Pending state until it is time for evaluation. Depending on the value, the alert will transition to the OK or Alerting state.

Disabling an alert causes the alert to transition to the Disabled state.
