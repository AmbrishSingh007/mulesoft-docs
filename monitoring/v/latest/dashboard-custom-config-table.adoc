= Configuring Tables in a Custom Dashboard

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can configure data and pagination properties of tables for custom dashboards. *TODO: OTHER PROPERTIES ARE CONFIGURABLE* By default, a table includes a Time column that you can configure or change to another type of column.

//REVISE IF USED: The new table panel is very flexible, supporting both multiple modes for time series as well as for table, annotation and raw JSON data. It also provides date formatting and value formatting and coloring options.
