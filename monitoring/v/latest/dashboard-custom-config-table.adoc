= Configuring Tables in a Custom Dashboard

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can configure tables for custom dashboard. You can lay out time-series data, aggregations, and other data in tabular format. You can also set pagination properties, as well as features that are common to other charts, such advanced or basic mode configurations and time ranges. By default, a table includes a Time column that you can configure or change to another type of column.

// TIME RANGE SETTINGS shared by singlestat and table

== Options

You can data layout, column, and paging options for tables in a custom dashboard.

2+| Value Settings
| Time Series to Rows | Creates a table that shows values for a given metric at a given time period. Like Time Series to Columns, the first column, Time, is for timestamps (such as `2018-04-25 06:37:40`). However, subsequent columns are Metric (for listing specific metrics, such as `worker-0`) and Value for listing the values of the metric at that time period.
| Time Series to Columns a|

Creates a table that shows values for a given metric at a given time period. Like Time Series to Rows, the first column, Time, is for timestamps. However, there is a column for each metric, such as `worker-0`, which lists the values of that metric at a given time period.

| Time Series to Aggregations a|

Transforms time series into a table that calculates totals, averages, and so on for a given metric. The first column, Metric, is for metrics such as `worker-0`, and subsequent columns are for any combination of these values: Avg, Min, Max, Total, Current, or Count for a given metric.
