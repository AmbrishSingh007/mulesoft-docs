Built-in dashboards contain the following graphs:

* Messages Processed: Number of messages at a given time point.
* Response Time by Inbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from inbound endpoints to your Mule app.
* Response Time by Outbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from outbound endpoints of your Mule app.
* CPU: Percentage of CPU used over time. The percentages are calculated per worker and as the total for all workers.
