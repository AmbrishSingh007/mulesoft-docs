= Configuring Text Panels in a Custom Dashboard

You can add text panels to custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring. A text panel can provide information about your dashboard. You can one to any row in the dashboard.

You can write in these modes:

* HTML
* Markdown

.Text Panel in a Custom Dashboard

You can see how your text will appear as you type.

.Markdown Example

The same example looks like this in HTML.

.HTML Example

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes or exit the configuration without saving and return to the dashboard by clicking the `X`.

THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE UI, PER PABLO:
Text panels also support a templating language and provide auto-complete features. For example, when you start typing, you can see a list of matching template options from which you can select and edit, such as these:

----
{% codeblock %}
code_snippet
{% endcodeblock %}
{% img class URL width height title_text alt_text %}
----
