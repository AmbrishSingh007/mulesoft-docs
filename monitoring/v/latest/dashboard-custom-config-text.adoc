As the next example shows, you can see how your text will appear in the UI as you type.

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, simply click the `X`.

THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE UI, PER PABLO:
Text panels also support a templating language and provide auto-complete features. For example, when you start typing, you can see a list of matching template options from which you can select and edit, such as these:

----
{% codeblock %}
code_snippet
{% endcodeblock %}
{% img class URL width height title_text alt_text %}
----
