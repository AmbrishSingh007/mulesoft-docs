= About Logs

The Monitoring Center aggregates your log files so you can manage, search for, filter, and analyze your logs. These feature support:

* Comparative analysis and identification of event and information patterns based on searches across selected Mule apps and environments.
* Searches within the logs of a specific worker (or set of workers) for a Mule app so that you can narrow scope of issues to check.
* Sharing a snapshot of important logs with developers who can work on the source of the issue.
