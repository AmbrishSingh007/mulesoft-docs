= Getting Alerts on the Health of an App

*TODO: STEPS, AND DESCRIPTION OF SCALABLE ALERTS*
////
Scalable alerts: Limited, Per App (base subscription) vs. Included, Unlimited for Premium Add on

Alerting allows you to define different rules (thresholds) and policies for different resources. When these rules are "crossed" for a certain period of time, you receive notification to take action. The method of notification depends on the severity of the alert that you define

Alerting features include:

* Threshold-based alerting: Notification when a specific metric that is related to a resource goes beyond the acceptable threshold for the period of time that you define.
* Batch Alert Assignments: Assignment of your alert definitions to multiple resources of the same type at once to help you save time of setting up each individually.
* Channel Integrations: Ability to specify a channel (such as PagerDuty, SMS, or Slack) to which notifications are sent.
* Alert Rollup: Ability to received a limited number of notifications on the same issue so that crucial notifications do not get overlooked because they are buried within a lot of redundant notifications.
* Alert History: An Alert History page shows status changes of a single alert. When you are troubleshooting an issue, you can have a view of historic data and see if the current issue has any  precedent.
