Dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring provide visibility into Mule apps that are deployed to your environments (for example, Production, Sandbox, or Design).

== Built-In Dashboards

Built-in dashboards contain a set of time-series graphs that plot current and historical data collected over a given time and date period. There is a built-in dashboard for each Mule app in each environment.

Built-in dashboards contain the following graphs:

* Response Time by App: Number of milliseconds (ms) required for each response.
* Messages Processed: Number of messages at a given time point.
* Response Time by Inbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from inbound endpoints to your Mule app.
* Response Time by Outbound Endpoint: Number of milliseconds (ms) for a response from outbound endpoints of your Mule app.
* CPU: Percentage of CPU used over time. The percentages are calculated per worker and as the total for all workers.
* Memory: Number of mebibytes (MiB) used over time.

== Custom Dashboards

//NOTE: from orig outline
//*TODO: GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF WIDGETS, SEE BELOW, and is USING INFO SIMPLE ENOUGH TO ADD TO THIS PAGE OR IS ANOTHER NEEDED?*

Custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring can bring together important metrics and data points that you need to see on one screen. You can specify the resources and metrics that you want to monitor, allowing you to:

* Correlate diverse metrics
* Perform comparative analysis
* Differentiate between regular trends and anomalies
* Isolate issues quickly

An important use case is compare live data with historic data so that you can detect anomalies and expedite the troubleshooting process.
