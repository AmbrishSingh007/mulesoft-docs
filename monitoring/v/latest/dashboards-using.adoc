= Using Dashboards

Built-in dashboards contain a standard set of graphs, while custom dashboards can display additional data that is important to your organization.

Both dashboards provide many of the same display options.

== Viewing a Dashboard

Built-in and Custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring.

* For built-in dashboards, you need to select an environment and Mule app.

== Setting Data Display Options in a Dashboard

//TODO: LICENSING MIGHT AFFECT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. NEED TO CHECK.
You can display the data points collected for the last given period of time (such as the last 5 or 30 minutes) or over a given date and time range. Depending on your license agreement, you might also be able to auto-refresh the displayed data.

=== Setting the Time Period to Display

You can use the drop-down in the calendar icon shown above to select the time period to display in a graph.

This configuration is for displaying data from the last given period of time in a graph:

Your setting applies across all graphs in the dashboard. A graph in the dashboard might look something like this:

.Example: Data from the Last 30 Minutes

Custom settings are useful for isolating data over a given date and time range:

=== Changing the Time Period to Display

You can display an earlier or later time period in your chart, and you can zoom in or out to cover a shorter or longer period of time.

To display earlier or later data, you can use the less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) icons.

To zoom out and display data over a longer time period, you use the magnifying glass icon located between the less-than and greater-than icons
|===

When you need to zoom in on activity that takes place at a specific time period, you use your mouse to narrow the time periods.

.Mousing Over a Period of Interest

For example, if you are currently looking at a graph that shows data for the last 30 minutes, you can narrow the range to the last 30 minutes to expose more detailed data points for the time period that concerns you.

=== Refreshing Data

You can refresh data in the graphs manually, or if your license permits, at a regular interval (such as 5s, 30s, 5m, 1h, 1d). Your refresh setting applies to all graphs in the dashboard.

.Auto and Manual Refresh Setting

Note that the manual refresh setting is the circular (cycle) icon to the right.

TODO: USE ANY OF THIS?

* Current time range and refresh interval: This shows the current dashboard time and refresh interval. It also acts as the menu button to toggle the time range controls.
* Quick ranges: Quick ranges are preset values to choose a relative time. At this time, quick ranges are not configurable, and will appear on every dashboard.
* Time range: The time range section allows you to mix both explicit and relative ranges. The explicit time range format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
* Refreshing every: When enabled, auto-refresh will reload the dashboard at the specified time range. Auto-refresh is most commonly used with relative time ranges ending in now, so new data will appear when the dashboard refreshes.
