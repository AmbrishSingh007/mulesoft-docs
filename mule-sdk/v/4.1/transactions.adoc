= Transactions
:keywords: mule, sdk, operation, source, tx, transactions, xa

The SDK gives the capability to create connectors that are able to join and create
a new transactions in a Mule Flow, including Source and Operations executions to
work as a unit where, so if a problem occurs inside the flow, all the components
participating in the transaction will rollback their execution as a unit, rolls
back the operations within the transaction so that no one part results in partial completion.

== Implementing Transactions in a Connector

Mule’s transaction support works on the premise of a transactional resource
identified by a key. *SDK* follows this concept reusing the connection abstraction
an using the component connection as the key of the transaction.
This means that in order to have a transaction, the extension must have a
`ConnectionProvider` which yields instances of the `TransactionalConnection` interface.

=== TransactionalConnection

To enable transactions in your connector the first requisite is having a
<<connections#, Connection Provider>> which provides connections implementing the
 `TransactionalConnection` interface.

The connection must implement methods `TransactionalConnection` that are used
 to communicate the beginning and conclusion of a transaction.

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class TXConnectionProvider implements ConnectionProvider<TXConnection> {
  ...
}
----
[source, java, linenums]
----
public class TxConnection implements TransactionalConnection {

    @Override
    public void begin() throws TransactionException {
        //logic to begin a transaction
    }

    @Override
    public void commit() throws TransactionException {
        //logic to commit a transaction

    }

    @Override
    public void rollback() throws TransactionException {
        //logic to rollback a transaction
    }
}

----

Implementing this interface requires to implement the following three methods:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|====
| Method | Description
|`begin()` | This method is called, when the transaction must begin.
|`commit()` | This is called when the transaction finished correctly and must be committed.
|`rollback()` | This is called then the transaction finished with an error and this one
must be be rollbacked.
|====

//TODO review how much of Operation TXs should be explained here and how much in the
// proper operations doc. The same with Sources.
=== Transactions in Operations

To make an Operation work under a transaction the `@Connection` parameter should
be a transactional capable connection, this means a connection implementing
`TransactionalConnection`.

==== Transactional Actions

When an operation is transactional, a synthetic parameter named `transactionalAction`
is automatically added to it. That parameter is an enum type which can take 3
possible values:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|=======
| Action Name | Description
|*ALWAYS_JOIN* | This means that the connector will always join to the existent
transaction, which implies if, there is no transaction or the current transaction
is not compatible with the current Operation, the operation execution will fail.
|*JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE* (Default) | If there is a transaction available, then use it, otherwise
continue processing
|*NOT_SUPPORTED* | The operation will execute outside any ongoing transaction.
|=======

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<try transactionalAction="BEGIN_OR_JOIN">
      <transactional-connector:work config-ref="config" transactionalAction="ALWAYS_JOIN"/>
</try>
----

===== Operation Transactional Actions inside the Operation Code

In some cases the Connector developer would like to know at Operation level which
`transactionalAction` has been configured in the Mule Application, for this use case
setting a parameter of `OperationTransactionalAction` type is all the required
work to inject the used value.

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void work(@Connection TxConnection connection, OperationTransactionalAction action) {
  //
}
----

==== Operation Transaction Usage

As you probably noticed by now, operations cannot start transactions. They must
either had been started by a <<sources#, Message Source>>, or the operation has
to be inside a `<try />` scope starting a new transaction.

Previously to the execution of the transactional operation, Mule will check if
the current transaction has a bounded key:

* If there is an already bounded key, because a previously Operation or Source had
already registered, Mule will check if this is compatible with the current Operation,
if so, the Operation will use the bounded connection, otherwise Mule the execution
flow will fail indicating that the current Operation was trying to enter to an
incompatible Transaction.

* If not, it will bound the Operation's
Connection as the key and execute the the `TransactionalConnection.begin()` communicating
that the transaction for the current Operation should start.

At the end of the execution of the transaction scope, the `<try />` scope or the
entire flow if the transaction was initialized by a <<sources#, Message Source>>,
Mule will call to `TransactionalConnection.commit()` if this one finished correctly,
otherwise, if an error occurred, `TransactionalConnection.rollback()` will be executed.

When the connection joins the transaction, the provider’s connection management
strategy is overridden, meaning that regardless of the connection’s strategy,
the same connection will be used for all matching operations between the
transaction’s scope.

WARNING: This behavior is not totally compatible with the concept of
`CachedConnectionProvider` since that would allow the same connection to join
different transactions concurrently, this implies that the connector developer
should know how to manage different transactions simultaneously in the same
connection.
The usage of `CachedConnectionProviders` with Transactions is totally discouraged.

=== Transactions in Sources

To make an Operation work under a transaction the `@Connection` parameter should be
a `ConnectionProvider` capable of provide transaction compatible connections.

==== Transactional Actions

===== Source Transactional Actions

When a Message Source is transactional, a synthetic parameter named `transactionalAction` is automatically
added to it. That parameter is an enum type which can take 2 possible values:

.Source Transactional Actions
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|=======
| Action Name | Description
|*ALWAYS BEGIN* | Will ensure that a new transaction is created for each invocation.
|*NONE* (Default) | The source will not start any transaction and will not participate of one opened in the Flow
|=======

===== Source Transactional Actions inside the Operation Code

In some cases the Connector developer would like to know at Source level which
`transactionalAction` has been configured in the Mule Application, for this use case
defining a parameter of `SourceTransactionalAction` type is all the required
work to inject the used value.

.Injecting SourceTransactionalAction to Source
[source, java, linenums]
----
public class TransactionalSource extends Source<String, Void> {

  @Connection
  private ConnectionProvider<TXConnection> connection;

  @Parameter
  private SourceTransactionalAction action;

  // rest of the code
}
----

=== XA Transactions

XA transactions are supported in a similar way. The only difference is that instead
of a `TransactionalConnection`, the provider should return an `XATransactionalConnection`,
which is a connection capable of returning a `XAResource`.
