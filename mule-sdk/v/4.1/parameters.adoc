= Parameters
:keywords: mule, sdk, parameter

Parameters are configurable arguments that belong to a given component.
<<configs#, Configurations>>, <<module-structure#components, Components>> and <<connections#, Connection Providers>>
are the components which we refer as being _parameterizables_, because
they are the ones that can be configured through their parameters.

The purpose of the parameters is to provide the information needed by the component so it can be
configured in order work properly. +
Each parameter contains the following information:

* A type that restricts the kind of value the parameter can have.
* A name that uniquely identifies it.

Let's see an example which is as easy as you can get:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
private String foo;
----

A parameter can be defined as a field of a class or as a method's argument,
depending on the kind of component you are dealing with.

For example, an <<operations#, operation>> parameter is defined as just any argument of the method that declares the operation.
It doesn't need to be annotated with `@Parameter`.

Just take a look at `foo` below.

[source, java, linenums]
----
public void method(String foo){}
----

== Using complex types

Now, let's move to more complex parameters instead of using simple types like strings and integers.

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
@Optional
private Options options;
----

Where `Options` is an `POJO Object` defined by us as:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class Options {

    @Parameter
    public String color;

    @Parameter
    @Optional
    public String mode;

    public String getColor(){
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color){
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getMode(){
        return mode;
    }

    public void setMode(String mode){
        this.mode = mode;
    }
}
----

A few notes about this example:

* The entire parameter `Options` is used as an optional parameter, so if you decide to use it you need to fulfill that all the required parameters inside `Options` have been set.
* If `options` is not configured, it value will be `null` (see <<null-safe#, NullSafe>> for altering this behavior).
* `Options` parameters must be Java bean properties (i.e. they need to have setters and getters matching the fields names).

=== Complex Type DSL

Complex types should be somehow separated from regular parameters, we can't just merge all the complex type attributes
with the element specific parameters because it will not have any sense.

That's why for Complex Types, a child definition will be created.
For example using the `Options` type in a <<configs#, Configuration>>:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<module:config name="config-name" someConfigAttribute="value">
  <module:options color="BLUE" mode="DARK"/>
</module:config>
----

[NOTE]
`module:options` is separated from the parameters `name` and `someConfigAttribute`.

== Modifiers

Parameters are highly customizable according to your needs, so let's see
a few modifiers you can use while defining a parameter to specify the right kind of behavior or restrictions for it.

=== Expression Support

An `ExpressionSupport` describes the parameter’s behavior when the value configured is a DataWeave expression.

There’re three possible values:

* `REQUIRED`: The parameter only accepts expressions.
* `SUPPORTED` (default): The parameter can handle both expressions and simple values.
* `NOT_SUPPORTED`: The parameter requires static values. Expressions are not supported.

This values can be simply configured just by adding the `@Expression` annotation.

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
@Expression(SUPPORTED)
private String foo;
----

So, in the example above we defined a parameter named `foo` of type `String` that
can have either a static value (like `"bar"`) or an expression (like `"\#[vars.foo]"`).

=== Optionality

Parameters can be either required or optionals.

Sometimes a parameter specifies information that is crucial to what we are trying to do (like the host name while doing an HTTP Request)
that there is no way in which we can continue without it being set,
and sometimes we can manage to operate without that information or just using a default value (assuming that a port would be 80 in an HTTP listener).

A parameter is required by default, but we can easily change that by annotating it with `@Optional`.

Let's look at a simple example.

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
@Optional(defaultValue="80")
private Integer port;
----

Take into account that `@Optional` only accepts `String` values, but the SDK will auto-convert it to your parameter's type.
Additionally, if the parameter supports expressions you can use one as the default value.

Optional parameters can have a default value.

=== Using @Alias

The name of each parameter will be the name given to the field in which it's defined. We can override this name by using the `@Alias` annotation.

Example:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
@Optional
@Alias("class")
private String clazz;
----

As you see, by using `@Alias` we can name the parameter as a Java reserved word, something that wouldn't be possible by
just naming the field as the reserved word.

=== Customizing the Parameter DSL

It is possible to customize how the Parameter looks and behaves in the DSL using the `@ParameterDsl` annotation.
This annotation allows setting directives regarding syntax and semantics of the generated XML DSL,
and can be applied to any Parameter in the model.

The `@ParameterDsl` annotation has two configurable elements:

====allowInlineDefinition:====
Defines whether the associated Parameter should support inline definition as child element or not.
This is used for customizing the DSL of Complex Type Parameters, specially when we need to avoid
the inline definition because it has illegal fields (like a `name` field) or because the structure
is so complex that makes no sense to represent it inline.

For example using the `Options` type in a <<configs#, Configuration>> but declaring the Parameter
with `@ParameterDsl(allowInlineDefinition=false)`, we no longer have the child element:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<module:config name="config-name" someConfigAttribute="value" options="#[vars.options]"/>
----

====allowReferences:====

Defines if the associated Parameter should support registry references when receiving an `String`.
This is useful to control how the Parameter will behave upon configuration, if the type of the
Parameter doesn't provide enough information to automatically configure the references support.

For example, in the JMS Connector we want to avoid the user to inject an object from
the registry as a ConsumerType configuration, thus we declare it as not supporting references:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Parameter
@Optional
@Expression(NOT_SUPPORTED)
@ParameterDsl(allowReferences = false)
private ConsumerType consumerType;
----

[[groups]]
== Parameter Groups

The `@ParameterGroup` annotation allows to define a group of parameters which share some kind of
special relationship and thus it makes sense for them to belong to the same group.

How do we spot them? The parameters that should go inside a `@ParameterGroup` are the
ones that *travel together* all the times.

Using `@ParameterGroup` will also make a UI contribution rendering all the `@Parameters`
inside the group together in a box, separating them from other `@Parameters` that don't
belong to that group. For example:

image::parameters/group.png[Parameter Group]

As you can see in the image above, the `Connection` group contains 4 parameters,
and there are others like `Soap Version` that is not in that group, that's a nice way
to separate the concerns of the `Parameters`

An simple example could be a parameter group defined as follows:

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class ConnectionProperties {

    @Parameter
    public String host;

    @Parameter
    @Optional(defaultValue="80")
    public Integer port;

    public String getHost(){
        return host;
    }

    public void setHost(String host){
        this.host = host;
    }

    public Integer getPort(){
        return port;
    }

    public void setPort(Integer port){
        this.port = port;
    }
}
----

And then is used like this:

[source, java, lineums]
----
@ParameterGroup("Connection")
private ConnectionProperties properties;
----

`"Connection"` is the name of the `@ParameterGroup` and is the one that will be used in
the UI.

The class defining the `properties` `@ParameterGroup` will not have a parameter named *properties*.
Instead, it will contain the parameters that are defined inside `ConnectionProperties`. Those are:

* A required parameter named host
* An optional parameter named port

In other words, the class defining the parameter group is augmented with this extra parameters
and will contain the parameters defined inside of `ConnectionProperties` plus all the other parameters it have declared.

Take into account that each field annotated with `@ParameterGroup` must be a Java bean
property (i.e: it needs to have setters and getters matching the field name).

== POJO vs Parameter Group

`@ParameterGroup` can be configured so it can be written as a child element in the DSL
instead of being spread around the component that declared it.

In other words having an operation like this one:

[source, java, lineums]
----
public void execute(@ParameterGroup ConnectionProperties properties) { ... }
----

we will have this DSL:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<example:execute host="localhost" port="8080">
----

But if we configured the parameter group using `@ParameterGroup(showInDsl=true)` instead, the DSL would look like:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<example:execute message="Example message!">
    <example:properties host="localhost" port="8080"/>
</example:execute>
----

Since when a POJO `@Parameter` is defined we get the same DSL, this leads you to ask:

When should you I a POJO instead POJO annotated with `@ParameterGroup`?

There are some subtle differences between this two concepts.
You should definitely use a POJO if you care about the type as a whole and the structure it provides.

When we defined `ConnectionProperties` above, we just wanted to keep two parameters that are always configured
together but they don't represent an entity in our domain. It was only a handy way of keeping things that are
related indeed and show them together in the UI, but don't mean anything in particular.

But if we talk about our `Options` POJO defined above, we do care about the object per se instead of only caring about the parameters it contains.
For instance, it would make sense to have a list of `Options`, because each object is something on its own (in the OOP sense).
On the other hand if you can be using a class just for the sake of grouping things that go together but don't have any particular meaning on your module's domain,
which is the purpose of having the parameter group.
