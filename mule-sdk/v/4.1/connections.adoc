= Modules Connectivity Framework
:keywords: mule, sdk, connection, connectivity, management, pooling, cached, provider, connection-provider

Since Mule is an integration platform, connected modules (connectors) are probably the most common
type of modules.

The connectivity framework starts with the concept of a `ConnectionProvider`.
This is an interface responsible for creating, disconnecting and describing the
connection so that the runtime can handle it properly, while remaining abstracted
from the concerns of actually manage those connections.

== Declaring a Connection Provider

To declare a new `ConnectionProvider` you should create a new class that implements
the `ConnectionProvider` interface. The `ConnectionProvider` interface is a typed interface
receives one type argument that indicates the class of the instances that the `ConnectionProvider`
handles.

For example:
Here we are declaring `FooConnectionProvider` class that implements the `ConnectionProvider` interface.

[source, java, linenums]
----
public class FooConnectionProvider implements ConnectionProvider<FooConnection> {

  @Parameter
  private String password;

  public FooConnection connect() throws ConnectionException {
    return new FooConnection(password);
  }

  public void disconnect(FooConnection connection) {
    connection.invalidate();
  }

  public ConnectionValidationResult validate(FooConnection connection) {
    return connection.isValid() ?
      ConnectionValidationResult.success() :
      ConnectionValidationResult.failure("Connection is not valid", new InvalidConnectionException());
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
Is important to mark that all the defined `ConnectionProviders` must be instantiable,
public and have a default constructor.

When another component, such as an operation or source, requires access to the
connection, they will do it through instances of the `FooConnection` class.

The above example contains a `@Parameter` and 3 methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()` and `validate()`, let's
describe each.

=== Connection Provider Parameters

As any other `Module` element, the `ConnectionProviders` can have `@Parameters`.
All the `ConnectionProvider` `@Parameters` must be configurable elements that are
required to instantiate the actual connection, in the `connect()` method.

[WARNING]
Common `@Parameters` that are required by more than one operations must *not* be part
of the connection provider, that's a common case for <<configs#, Configurations>>
`@Parameter`. See: <<parameters#, `@Parameter` section>>

[[_connections_connect]]
=== Connect

The `connect()` method is the one in charge of instantiating the actual connections with
all the configured parameters information. It's *very important* to know that the returned
connection is expected to be ready to use.

The returned *connection* itself does not need to implement an interface or contract,
it doesn’t necessarily references the socket connection itself, it can simply be a
client or something of that sort.

=== Disconnect
The `disconnect(Connection)` method receives a live connection and disposes it freeing
all it's allocated resources.

=== Validate
As said <<_connections_connect, above>> the `connect()` method in the `ConnectionProvider` *must* return
a valid, fully functional connection. However they might become stale while sitting idle.
To prevent that, the `ConnectionProvider` has the `validate(Connection)` method which
will be invoked before a connection is used to check if still valid.

If the validation fails, then the connection will be invalidated and a new one will be taken.

==== Connection Validation Result

The `validate(Connection)` method will return an object of type `ConnectionValidationResult` which
can result on two types a `ConnectionValidationResult.success()` or a `ConnectionValidationResult.failure()`.

When a `failure()` is returned, a descriptive message and a failing `Exception` (which gives context on
why the connection is actually invalid) should be provided to the new `failure()`,
optionally an `ErrorType` can be provided to add the <<errors#, error handling>> capabilities.

* `failure(String, Exception)`
* `failure(String, ErrorType, Exception)`

== Adding a Connection Provider

`ConnectionProviders` are bounded to `Configurations`, so a `Configuration` can have none, one
or many `Connection Providers`.

In order to add a `ConnectionProvider` implementations to a `Module` `Configuration` the
`@ConnectionProviders` annotation must be introduced. This annotation is used to declare the
`ConnectionProviders` that a `Module` defines, it can be used at the `@Extension`
or `@Configuration` level.

If an extension contains more than one `ConnectionProvider`, then the `@Alias`
annotation is to be used to give each one a significant name. By convention,
the name of that connection provider will add the *“-connection”* suffix
to that provided name.

Example of a `ConnectionProvider` declared at `@Extension` level for the:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name="foo")
@Operations(Operations.class)
@ConnectionProviders(FooConnectionProvider.class)
public class FooModule {

  @Parameter
  private String someParameter;

  public String getSomeParameter() {
    return someParameter;
  }
}
----

Example of the XML for this config with the example `FooConnectionProvider`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<foo:config name="a-foo-config" someParameter="value">
    <foo:connection password="aVeryDificultPassword"/>
</foo:config>
----

== Connection Management

There are 3 different connection management strategies that can be specified for a
`ConnectionProvider`.

=== Pooling Strategy

The connections are pooled. A cache of connections is maintained so that they can be
reused when future requests require one.

This is useful when connections are expensive to be created, or concurrent access to a
connection instance is not supported.

// TODO link to MULE pooling profile configuration
For this pooling strategy `ConnectionProviders` a pooling profile configuration is
automatically added to the connection.

You can enable pooling connection management by implementing the `PoolingConnectionProvider` interface

=== Cached Strategy
Per each configuration instance, a connection is established and cached so that one specific
config always gets the same connection. The connection is maintained until the configuration itself
is stopped.

You can enable cached connection management by implementing the `CachedConnectionProvider` interface.

=== No Strategy

The runtime adds no additional infrastructure like in the pooling cases.
The `ConnectionProvider` is responsible for providing the totality of the
connection handling behavior. The `connect()` method is going to be called each
time an operation needs one and destroys it once the operation finishes.

Implementing the `ConnectionProvider` interface means no strategy.

== Using Connections

Using connections in Operations and Sources is quite different, so take a look at
both specific documentations to learn about that.
