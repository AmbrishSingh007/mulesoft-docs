= Learning the Module Model
:keywords: mule, sdk, module, extension, components, structure

The entry point for building a mule module is the `@Extension` annotated class,
this class is the one used to export all the module functionality and all the elements
associated to it.

[WARNING]
This class *must* be a public non-abstract class, the `@Extension` annotation cannot be used
on interfaces, abstract classes, private/protected classes nor typed classes (with generics).

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "basic")
public class BasicModule {
}
----

By using the `@Extension` annotation you will need to provide a descriptive and concise name for your module
(no `extension`, `module`, `connector` should be used to name the module, if one of this
words is included the SDK will trim them), optionally you can specify the module `vendor` and the
module `category` (See <<license#, Licensing>>).

One you have your empty module, you can start adding elements to it.

In the big picture we have the following elements:

[[components]]
* Components
** <<operations#, Operations>>
** <<sources#, Sources>>
** <<functions#, Functions>>
** <<routers#, Routers>>
** <<scopes#, Scopes>>
* <<connections#, Connection Providers>>
* <<configs#, Configurations>>
* <<parameters#, Parameters>>

Let's describe each of them shortly.

A diagram of a basic module structure.

== Components

The Components are the key of a module functionality, they work is that given a set of
parameters they can be executed altering or producing the messages in a flow.

<<sources#, `Sources`>> and <<operations#, `Operations`>> are the most common components in a module. <<operations#, `Operations`>> are
components which process an incoming message and generate a result, <<sources#, `Sources`>> are another
type component which receives or generates new messages to be processed by the Mule Runtime.

== Configuration

`Configurations` are a set of configurable parameters which affect the behavior of the Module.
Both <<sources#, `Sources`>> and <<operations#, `Operations`>> typically depend on a `Configuration` to get parameters on how they should
behave, but this is not required, there are those which do not require a configuration and can simply
work on their own.

Modules are not required to have a configuration, but if they do, they can also define
as many other configurations as needed. Different configurations might not only provide
a different set of parameters, but also specify their own set of <<operations#, `Operations`>> and <<sources#, `Sources`>>
which are only available when using that configuration.

== Connection Providers

A <<connections#, `Connection Provider`>> is the Module element in charge of handling connections,
which are created from a <<configs#, `Configuration`>>. They centralize the logic and parametrization
to provision and release connections of some specific type.

Like the <<configs#, `Configurations`>>, <<sources#, `Sources`>> and <<operations#, `Operations`>> typically depend on a *connection*
in order to be executed, this is not required, but is pretty common. The *connections* used
by <<operations#, `Operations`>> and <<sources#, `Sources`>> will be provided for this <<connections#, `Connection Providers`>>.

<<connections#, `Connection Providers`>> are bounded to the <<configs#, `Configurations`>>. <<configs#, `Configurations`>> can have none, one
or many <<connections#, `Connection Providers`>> that creates different types of *connections*. For example:
a `ConnectionProvider` for HTTPS and another one for (non-secured) HTTP *connections*.

== Parameters

The `Parameters` are the most granular element on the module model and they are used
in all the described elements: <<operations#, `Operations`>>, <<sources#, `Sources`>>, <<configs#, `Configurations`>> and <<connections#, `Connection Providers`>>.

They represent the configurable elements that accepts the values then used for elements
to execute or just to hold the configured values.

== Other Elements

There are more element types that a module can have, for example: <<routers#, `Routers`>>, <<routers#, `Scopes`>>, <<functions#, `Functions`>> or
<<errors#, `Errors`>> between others, all of them are documented in a separated section. The ones
described here are the core elements that probably most modules will have.
