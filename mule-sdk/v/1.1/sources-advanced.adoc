== @PrimaryNodeOnly

*Available since version 1.1*

Using the annotation `@PrimaryNodeOnly` at a class level for a Source means it will only run on the primary node when running in cluster mode.
The runtime will only start the source when the mule instance becomes the primary node.

This is an example of how to use the annotation:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@PrimaryNodeOnly
public class JmsListener extends Source<Object, JmsAttributes> {
// ...
}
----
