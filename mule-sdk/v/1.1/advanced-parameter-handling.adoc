= Advanced Parameter Handling



There are features in the SDK that can drastically improve the quality of your module by adding UI and UX tuning, enabling extension points for your Module so it can interact with elements of other Modules, and also providing implementation enhancements to avoid boilerplate code in the Module:

* link:parameter-layout[Customizing the Parameters UI]
* link:parameters-dsl[Customizing the Parameters DSL]
* link:exclusive-optionals[Exclusive Optional]

== Extension Points and Modules Reuse:

* link:imported-types[Importing Types From Other Modules]
* link:subtypes-mapping[Using Generic Parameters For Extended Behavior]
* link:stereotypes[Stereotypes As A Way Of Referencing Elements By Kind]


== Implementation Enhancers:
