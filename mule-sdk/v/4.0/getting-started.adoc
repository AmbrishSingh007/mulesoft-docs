= Getting Started with the Mule SDK
:keywords: mule, sdk, create, new, project, getting, started

The following topics help you start developing Mule SDK projects.

== Setting Up Your Development Environment

You must have the following components installed and working in your local environment:

* Java Development Kit 8 (JDK 8) to compile and build your Java code.

* Apache Maven, version 3.3.9 or higher, to manage your projectâ€™s build

=== Setting up your IDE

In order to work, the SDK requires that the command line parameter `-parameters`
is passed to the java compiler.

==== If you use Studio

Studio and Eclipse users should right click on the project and then go to: `Java Compiler` and
enable the *Store information about method parameters (usable via reflection)*

==== If you use IntelliJ

If you are using IntelliJ go to: `Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler`
and add `-parameters` in the *Additional command line parameters* section.

== Creating your first SDK project.

The SDK provides a Maven Plugin and a Maven Archetype to create new projects, an archetype is defined
as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made.

=== Generating a project using the Maven Plugin

There is a maven plugin with steps and descriptions for the required fields in order
to create a new Extension Project

By running the following command you will get prompt for values.

----
mvn org.mule.extensions:mule-extensions-archetype-maven-plugin:generate
----

=== Generating a project using the Maven Archetype Directly

You can also create a the project by invoking the archetype directly
with the following properties.

----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.mule.extensions
                       -DarchetypeArtifactId=mule-extensions-archetype
                       -DarchetypeVersion=1.1.0
                       -DgroupId=org.mule.extension.basic
                       -DartifactId=basic-extension
                       -DextensionName=Basic
----

=== The Generated Project

The generated project contains the basic mule <<module-structure#, module structure>> with some basic
classes with dummy implementation and two running tests that use's the generated
module.

As this project is a maven project contains a pom.xml file that with all the
information and configuration details used by Maven to perform the build, this
generated pom file inherits from the modules parent pom containing all the common
configurations and defaults for all mule module projects.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<parent>
  <groupId>org.mule.extensions</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-modules-parent</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</parent>
----

== Building the project

Once your project is generated you can build it by running the following command

----
mvn clean install
----

By executing this you will compile your project, run the tests and install it in
your local maven repository.

== Start Developing

Now you are ready to add your custom module code! Find the `@Extension` annotated class
then take a look to the detailed <<module-structure#, module structure>> and the different
elements that can be added to a module.
