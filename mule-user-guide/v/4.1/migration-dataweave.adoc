[[dw_header]]
== DataWeave Header Content

Most of the header directives have been changed in DataWeave. The `%dw` directive is an exception. In most cases, MuleSoft removed the `%`, and in some cases the keyword is shortened.

[%header,cols=“1,1”]
|===
|DataWeave 1.0 |DataWeave 2.0 |
|`%dw 1.0`    |`%dw 2.0`|
|`%output`    |`output` |
|`%var`       | `var`   |
|`%function`  | `fun`   |
|`%namespace` | `ns`    |
|===

[[dw_flow_control]]
== Flow Controls

Flow control changed somewhat in DataWeave 2.

[[dw_flow_control_when_otherwise]]
=== When Otherwise

The `when otherwise` statement is replaced by `if else`, for example:

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source, linenums]
----
{
    sex: "Male" when flowVar.sex == "M" otherwise "Female"
}
----

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source, linenums]
----
{
    sex: if(flowVar.sex == "M") "Male" else "Female"
}
----
//TODO? flowVar to vars?

[[dw_flow_control_pattern_matcher]]
=== Pattern Matcher

Pattern matching changed in DataWeave 2. It adds the keyword `case` and `else` (instead of `default`).

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source, linenums]
----
'world' match {
    :string -> true,
    default -> false
  }
----

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source, linenums]
----
'world' match {
    case is String -> true,
    else -> false
  }
----

For type pattern matchers, the is keyword needs to be set.

[[dw_type_references]]
== Type References

The `:` was removed from the type references and are now all camel case, so `:string` is now `String`

[[dw_object_coercion]]
== Object Coercion

In DataWeave 1.0, selecting a key-value pair from an object required you to do something like this:

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source,linenums]
----
%var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.a as :object
----

The DataWeave 1.0 expression above returns `{a:1}`. Because this is a coercion, it is also included in the auto-coercion mechanism and generates undesired or unexpected results.

In DataWeave 2.0, the coercion is removed, and a new selector (`&`) is introduced to select key-value parenthesis.
//TODO: To select a key-value pair from an object or something like that?

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 2
[source, linenums]
----
var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.&a
----

This expression also returns `{a:1}`.

[[dw_cond_key_value_parens]]
== Conditional Key-Value Parenthesis

In DataWeave 1.0, conditional key-value pairs are declared with the `when` keyword.

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source, linenums]
----
{
    (a: 1) when payload.product == "Mule"
}
----

In DateWeave 2.0, you use the `if`.

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source, linenums]
----
{
    (a: 1) if payload.product == "Mule"
}
----

////
[[dw_content_types]]
== Supported Content Types

* For the flat file, the content type is `application/flatfile` instead of `text\plain`.

.Mule 3 example
----
text\plain
----

.Mule 4 example
----
application/flatfile
----

[[dw_operators]]
== DataWeave Operators (Functions)

* All operators are now functions (for example, `upper()`, `typeOf()`). Therefore, they must include their arguments between parenthesis.
* Custom functions are declared in the DataWeave header via the keyword `fun`, rather than `function`. For example, `fun funName(args) = body`
* `when`, `unless` and `otherwise` are no longer used for conditional logic. They have been replaced by `if` and `else`. This requires that you change the order of the expression. Example: `if payload is(String) uppercase(payload)`.
* Binary functions (that take two arguments) support an alternative infix notation (arg1 function arg2). For example, `payload.*items contains "3"` instead of `contains(payload.*items, "3")`.
* The functions `filter` and `groupBy` are overloaded to operate on objects.
* The functions `map`, `mapObject` and `filter` support a null input (in which case they return null).
* New supported syntax for `match` when using arrays `[head ~ tail]`
* Multiple functions are no longer packaged as part of the core functions module. The package they belong to must be manually imported in the header before they can be called.
* Index parameter: Added `index` as a third parameter to `mapObject`, `pluck`, `filter`, and `groupBy`.

== DataWeave Selectors

* The `..` operator is no longer used for selecting ranges (but still works as a descendants selector). Its functionality is replaced by `to`. Example: `[2 to 15]`.
* New key-value pair selector (`.&`) returns all matching keys and values. It returns them as a single object containing these.
* New namespace selector (`.#`) returns the namespace used.
 ** Namespace prefixes can no longer contain the character `-`.
* Repeated fields: Added the asterisk (`\*`) for repeated fields in an object, for example: `{ a*: String}`. This is primarily needed for XML, where the names of child elements can be repeated, unlike keys in Java and JSON objects.

== DataWeave Syntax

* Closed objects: For declared types, added the pipe (`|`) syntax to specify a closed (or exact) object. For example, if `{|a: String|}` is specified as a return type of a function, the function cannot return `{a: String, b: Number}`.
* Ordered objects: Added the hyphen character (`-`) for ordered objects, for example: `{- a: String, b: Number -}`. The fields must be in the specified order.

== OTHER TODOS...

TODO: MENTIONS OF DATAWEAVE NOTE HERE. In most cases, the DW info relates to a change to a processor, so prob best fits into migration doc for that processor.

== DataWeave 1.0 to 2.0

=== DataWeave Header Content

Most of the header directives have been changed (expect for the version %dw directive)

| DW 1.0 | DW 2.0 |
| %dw 1.0 | %dw 2.0|
| %output| output |
| %var   | var    |
| %function | fun |
| %namespace | ns |

We remove the `%` and in some cases we shorten it.

=== Flow Controls

==== When otherwise

When otherwise was replaced by if else

So for example

-------
{
    sex: "Male" when flowVar.sex == "M" otherwise "Female"
}
-------

is now

-------
{
    sex: if(flowVar.sex == "M") "Male" else "Female"
}
-------


==== Pattern matcher

Pattern matcher changed by adding the keyword `case` and `else` (instead of `default`)

----
'world' match {
    :string -> true,
    default -> false
  }
----

Is now

----
'world' match {
    case is String -> true,
    else -> false
  }
----

For type pattern matchers the is keyword needs to be set.


=== Type references

The `:` was removed from the type references and are now all camel case so `:string` is now `String`

=== Object coercion

In dw 1.0 is a user needed to select a key value pair from an object it required to do something like

----
%var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.a as :object
----

This expression returns `{a:1}`. The main problem with this was that as it was a coercion it also was included in the auto-coercion mechanism and it generated un desire/un-expected results.

In dw 2.0 the coercion was removed and a new selector was introduce to be able to select key value parenthesis

----
var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.&a
----

This expression also returns `{a:1}`.


=== Conditional key value parenthesis

In dw 1.0 conditional key value pairs are declared with the `when` keyword
----
{
    (a: 1) when payload.product == "Mule
}
----

In dw 2.0 we use the `if`

----
{
    (a: 1) if payload.product == "Mule
}
----
