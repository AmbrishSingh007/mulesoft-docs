DataWeave functions are packaged in modules. Functions in the Core (`dw::Core`) module are imported automatically into your DataWeave scripts. To use other modules, you need to import the module or functions you want to use by adding the import directive to the head of your DataWeave script, for example:

* `import dw::core::Strings`
* `import camelize, capitalize from dw::core::Strings`
