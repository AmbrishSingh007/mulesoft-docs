= Round Robin Router
:keywords: routers, flows, processor chain, async, aggregator, resequencer

The Round Robin router iterates through a list of two or more message processors, sending successive messages to the next message processor on the list. When it reaches the end of the list, it jumps to the start of the list and resumes the iteration.

It is a message processor that iterates through a list of child message processors in round-robin fashion: the first message received is routed to the first child, the second message to the second child, and so on. After a message has been routed to each child, the next is routed to the first child again, restarting the iteration.
