= Migrating the Mule Security Module (AES)

In Mule 3, there were many security-related modules inside the security module, that were separated in different modules. These are: 

// Add Encryption link when it's finished
// link:ADDLINK[Encryption]: replaced by link:ADDLINK[Mule Cryptography Module]
- link:migration-security-filters[Filters]: replaced by link:/connectors/v/latest/validation-connector[Mule Validation Module]
// Add OAuth doc ref after it's finished
- link:migration-secure-properties-placeholder[Secure Properties Placeholder]: replaced by link:secure-configuration-properties[Mule Secure Configuration Properties]
// Add Signature link when Encryption is finished
// link:ADDLINK[Signature]: also replaced by link:ADDLINK[Mule Cryptography Module]
