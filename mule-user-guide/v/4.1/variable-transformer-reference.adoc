The Set Variable component is for creating or updating a variable to store values for use within the flow of a Mule app. You can store simple literal values such as strings or messages, message payloads, or attribute objects. For example, you might store the original payload of a message (before it is processed) so you can use it later in the flow or within an exception strategy.

|Field | Description

| Display Name (`doc:name`)
| Customize to display a unique name for this component in your flow. Defaults to Set Variable.

| Name of the variable. Names can only include numbers, characters, and underscores. For example, hyphens are not allowed in the name.

| Value (`value`)
| Value for the variable, which can be a string or a DataWeave expression.

| Encoding (`encoding`)
| (Optional) Sets the MIME encoding, such as `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

| MIME Type (`mimeType`)
| (Optional) Sets the MIME type, such as `text/plain` or `text/json`.

== Examples

This example sets the variable to a string:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `my first variable`

This example sets the variable by using a DataWeave operation that results in a value of `5`:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `#[max([1,2,3] ++ [3,4,5])]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message payload:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `payload` in Design Center, `#[payload]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message attributes:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `attributes` in Design Center, `#[attributes]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the entire message:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `message` in Design Center, `#[message]` in Anypoint Studio.

This XML example sets a variable that takes a map as a value:
`<set-variable variableName="employee" value="{ 'name' : 'Ana', 'office' : 'BA' }" mimeType="application/json" encoding="UTF-8/>`

This example sets the same variable using selectors in a DataWeave script. It assumes the `name` attribute is available as input to Set Variable:
`<set-variable variableName="employee" value="#[output application/java --- payload.name]"/>`
