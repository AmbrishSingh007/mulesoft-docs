[[short_description]]
Flow Ref routes the Mule event to another flow or subflow and back within a same Mule application. You can treat the entire referenced flow like a single component in your current flow.

Flow Ref breaks up the Mule app into discrete and potentially reusable units. For example, a flow that lists files on a regular basis might reference another flow that processes the output of the List operation. Instead of appending all the processing steps, you can append a Flow Ref that points to the processing flow.

In this example, the Flow Ref component points to a subflow called ProcessFiles.

The diagram below shows the order of processing when one flow references another. When the main flow is triggered, the Mule event travels through and executes the flow until the event reaches Flow Ref. The event then travels through and executes the referenced flow from beginning to end, and returns to the main flow.
