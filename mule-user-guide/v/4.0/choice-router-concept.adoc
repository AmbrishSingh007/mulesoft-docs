= Choice Router

The Choice flow control component dynamically routes execution based on the contents of its input. It adds conditional processing to a flow, similar to an `if`/`then`/`else` code block in most programming languages.

A Choice flow control component uses expressions written in DataWeave language to evaluate the content of the input. It then routes to the first option that matches the expression (evaluates to `true`).

* A When (`when`) block is executed when the input matches its condition.

* The Otherwise (`otherwise`) block is executed by default if none of the conditions match the When block.

You can provide a custom name to each condition. This only has an effect on what you see in the editor, not the behavior of the application.
