= About the Mule Error

Each component in a Mule application declares the type of errors it throws. So it's easy for you to identify potential errors when designing a Mule flow. +
The error declared by a component is a Mule Error.

Each Mule Error has the following components:

* A description regarding the problem.
* A type, used to characterize the problem.
* A cause, the underlying Java Throwable that resulted in the failure.
* An optional error message, which is used to include a proper Mule Message regarding the problem.

For example, when an HTTP request fails with a 401 status code, the Mule Error looks like this

----
Description: HTTP GET on resource ‘http://localhost:36682/testPath’ failed: unauthorized (401)
Type: HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED
Cause: a ResponseValidatorTypedException instance
Error Message:  { "message" : "Could not authorize the user." }
----

== About Mule Error Types

In the example above, the error type is HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED, not simply UNAUTHORIZED. +
Error types consist of both namespace and an identifier, allowing you to distinguish the types according to their domain.
For example, there are the HTTP:NOT_FOUND and FILE:NOT_FOUND error types. +
While connectors define their own namespace, core runtime errors have the implicit MULE: runtime. +
So MULE:EXPRESSION and EXPRESSION are interpreted as one.

Another important characteristic of error types is that they may have a parent type. For example, HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED has MULE:CLIENT_SECURITY as the parent, which, in turn, has MULE:SECURITY as the parent. This establishes error types as specifications of more global ones: an HTTP unauthorized error is a type of client security error, which is a type of a more broad security issue.

These hierarchies allow routing to be more general. For example, a handler for MULE:SECURITY catches HTTP unauthorized errors as well as OAuth errors. +
Below you can see what the core runtime’s hierarchy looks like:

All errors are either general or CRITICAL, the latter being so severe that they cannot be handled. At the top of the general hierarchy is ANY, which allows matching all types under it. It’s important to note the UNKNOWN type, which is used when no clear reason for the failure is found.

This error can only be handled through the ANY type to allow specifying the unclear errors in the future, without changing existing apps behavior. When it comes to connectors, each connector defines its error type hierarchy considering the core runtime one, though CONNECTIVITY and RETRY_EXHAUSTED types are always present––since they are common to all connectors.
