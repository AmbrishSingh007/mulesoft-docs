[[pluck1]]
== pluck({ (K)?: V }, (V, K, Number) -> R): Array<R>

Pluck is useful for mapping an object into an array. Pluck is an alternate mapping mechanism to mapObject.
Like mapObject, pluck executes a lambda over every key:value pair in its processed object as a tuple,
but instead of returning an object, it returns an array, which may be built from either the values or the keys in the object.

The lambda is invoked with three parameters: *value*, *key* and *index*.
If these parameters are not named, the value is defined by default as *$*, the key *$$* and the index *$$$*.
