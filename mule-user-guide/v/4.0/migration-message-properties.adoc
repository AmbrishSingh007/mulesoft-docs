= Migrating Message Properties

In Mule 3 there were 4 different properties `scopes` that the user could use for different purposes. In Mule 4 we get rid of most of those scopes for simplicity.

== Invocation properties

Invocation properties are now called `variables` in Mule 4. Their behaviour is exactly the same as in Mule 3.

== Inbound properties, outbound properties, inboind attachemnts and outbound attachemnts

All this scopes do not exists anymore. See link:intro-mule-message[Intro Mule Message] for more information about migration
