= Migrating transformers

Mule 4 does not requires the concept of `transformers` anymore as a core concept. With the addition of DataWeave as default expression language and the repetable streams feature most (if not all) scenarios that required transformer no longer exists.

== Migrating type transformers

In Mule 3 the same data could be represented using different types. For instance a JSON could be stored using a String, InputStream, OutputHandler or ByteArray. In the same way an XML could be represented with those same types or also in a java DOM document.

Now every format that is not binary is handled automatically by Mule without the user having to care about the actual type carrying the content.

=== InputStream to string transformations

The `<object-to-string-transformer>` was commonly used so data that was held by an InputStream were able to be consumed by more than one processor. Since Mule 4 has the concept of repetable streams, this is no longer required.

=== Object model representation for JSON and XML

To access the content of XML document or JSON document a convertion to a java object representation model was needed so later on java code or MEL could be used. Since now the expression language of the runtime has complete support for JSON and XML (and many other formats) such conversion is no longer needed. Just use a DataWeave expression to access the data and that's it.

== Migrating custom transformers

Most likely custom transformers that were used to handle formats supported by DataWeave are no longer needed and could be migrated to use the expression language. The DataWeave script can be externalize to a file in case that the same transformation needs to be done in several places.

In case there is a use case that is transforming data and DataWeave does not support such transformation you should use the `java module` or the `scripting module` and use custom code to perform the transformation.
