= For Each Scope


The For Each scope (`foreach`) splits a payload into elements and processes them one by one through the components that you place in the scope. It is similar to a for-each/for-loop code block in most programming languages.

It can process any a collection, including maps, lists, arrays. The collection can be any supported content type, such as `application/json`, `application/java`, `application/xml`.

== Differences With a Splitter

The For Each scope performs a similar task to using a Splitter and then an Aggregator. The main difference is that the For Each scope outputs a collection just like the one it receives, the Aggregator outputs a message where the payload is a list of mule messages (each with its own payload and attributes).
////

* If the input is a simple Java collection, the For Each scope can split it without any configuration.

* For non-Java input, such as XML or JSON, you need to use a DateWeave expression to split data. You use the Collection (`collection`) field for this purpose.
+
Here, the Collection field in For Each is set to iterate over an array stored in `payload.topics`.

////
Note that if the input contains information outside the collection you tell it to split, this information is lost.
////

You can also split an array in batches. Potentially, these batches promote quicker processing. Each batch is treated as a separate Mule message. For example, if a collection has 200 elements and you set Batch Size (`batchSize`) to `50`, the For Each scope iteratively processes 4 batches of 50 elements, each as a separate Mule message.

== Error Handling

If one of the elements in a collection throws an exception, the For Each scope stops processing that collection and invokes the error handler.

== Persisting Data

In case the message inside the For Each scope is persisted, not only the item in the collection is serialized but also all the variables associated with it. The rootMessage variable, associated with the message, contains a reference to the complete, unsplit collection. Therefore, serialization/deserialization of the rootMessage variable could impact memory consumption considerably when this collection is large enough.

To avoid this issue you must first remove the rootMessage variable from the message before persisting it.
