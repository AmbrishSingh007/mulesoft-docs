===== encodeURIComponent(String): String

The encodeURIComponent() function encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by
one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character
(will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

encodeURIComponent escapes all characters except the following: alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
encodeURIComponent differs from encodeURI in that it encodes reserved characters and the Number sign # of encodeURI:
