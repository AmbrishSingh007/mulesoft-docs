= About Virtual Private Cloud

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering allows you to create a virtual, private, and isolated network segment in the cloud to host your CloudHub workers.

As opposed to the default configuration, where all CloudHub workers reside in a multi-tenant global public worker cloud, balanced by a publicly accessible load balancer, the Virtual Private Cloud allows you to host your CloudHub workers in a logically private and isolated network, and assign them an internal IP address within the address space determined by you.

By connecting to your CloudHub VPC via a secure VPN connection, you can extend your corporate intranet -whether one of your on-prem data centers, or one of your private AWS VPCs-  as if they were all part of a single, private network. This allows CloudHub workers to access resources behind your corporate firewall. +
You can leverage an IPSec gateway or Amazon Web Services Direct Connect for VPN connectivity. +
Keep in mind that you can't reuse your existing AWS VPC as an CloudHub VPC.

One VPC can be associated with multiple environments. +
CloudHub VPC supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. You can even have multiple VPCs inside a single Amazon region, however this is not a standard setup and you need to specify this requirement when provisioning your VPC.

Each VPC can host one or more dedicated load balancers with a DNS A record that you can add to your own DNS CNAME record to point to. This way you can configure your VPC's load balancer to handle requests to your own domain, allowing you to set your private DNS server so the Mule applications hosted in your VPC workers can use your private hostnames to communicate with your private resources.

Additionally, you can configure firewall rules to apply to your workers. You can choose to expose or block your custom ports and even block requests to your apps coming from CloudHub's publicly accessible load balancer so you balance your requests using your own dedicated load balancer.


The base VPC subscription includes 2 VPCs. You can purchase as many VPCs as required. +
For more information on VPC pricing, contact your MuleSoft Account Executive.
