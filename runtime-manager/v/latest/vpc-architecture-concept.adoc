= About VPC Architecture

A VPC is a logically private and isolated network hosted inside Cloudhub. You can connect your private intranet to your Cloudhub VPC as if they were all part of a single, private network. +
The VPC configuration exposes the DNS record "mule-worker-internal-<app-name>.cloudhub.io". This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of all your workers. This DNS record cannot be accessed from outside your VPC.

Each VPC allows you to configure firewall rules to check inbound connections directly to your workers. +
Four firewall rules are created by default: 2 rules allowing your private address space through ports 8091 and 8092, and 2 rules that whitelist external requests proxied by Cloudhub's shared load balancer through ports 8081 and 8092. +
All traffic that is not whitelisted in a firewall rule, is blocked by default.

The graphic below shows a default VPC architecture:

Additionally you can configure a dedicated load balancer inside your VPC. +
This service allows you to  provide custom certificates and optionally enforce two-way SSL client authentication, and  configure proxy rules that map your applications to custom domains, enabling you to for example host everything under a single vanity domain.

A VPC architechture with a dedicated load balancer would look like this:

All VPCs need to be created inside a master organization or business group, and associated to a CloudHub region, and an environment. Every application deployed to that organization/business group, region, and environment is then automatically deployed to your VPC. +
Because you can have more than one VPC per region, you can choose to set your VPC as default for a specific region. This associates the VPC to all environments in that region that are not explicitly associated with other VPC. +

For example, if you have three environments in US-EAST:

. Production
. QA
. Staging

And setting one VPC (vpc-1) for _Production_ in *US-EAST* and vpc-2 as default for *US-EAST* causes for all applications deployed to _Staging_ and _QA_ to automatically deploy to vpc-2.

Applications that were deployed before creating your VPC are not automatically migrated. It is necessary to redeploy the applications so they can be hosted in the VPC.
