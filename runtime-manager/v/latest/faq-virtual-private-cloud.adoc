= FAQ: Virtual Private Cloud

== Can I reuse my existing Amazon VPC?

No, but we can set up your CloudHub VPC to communicate with your existing Amazon VPC.

== How does VPC work with Amazon regions?

Our VPC solution supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. If you need support for multiple regions, please submit one copy of the discovery form for each region in which you need support.Â 

== Can I have multiple VPCs?

Yes, customers can purchase as many VPCs as required, with a minimum purchase of two.  For more information on VPC pricing, contact your MuleSoft Account Executive.

== Can I have multiple VPCs in a single Amazon region?

Yes, this is possible, but not included in our standard setup. Contact your account representative to discuss your requirements.

== How do I communicate with my workers through my VPC without going over the public Internet?

You can communicate with your Mule worker by using mule-worker-internal-myapp.cloudhub.io as the address in your configuration. This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of all your workers.
