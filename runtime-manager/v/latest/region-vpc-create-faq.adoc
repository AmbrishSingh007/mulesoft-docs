= FAQ: In Which Region Create a VPC

You can create your VPC inside any of the available CloudHub regions. +
The recommended region to use might vary depending on how would you connect to your VPC. If you are using a VPN tunnel, you might want to choose the closed CloudHub region to your data center. +
However, if you are peering with your private AWS VPC, you need to create your CloudHub VPC in the same AWS region, or, if available, you can create an inter-region VPC peering connection between the following regions only:

* US East (N. Virginia).
* US West (Oregon).
* EU (Ireland).
* US East (Ohio).
