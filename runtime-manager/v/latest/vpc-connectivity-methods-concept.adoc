[NOTE]

IPsec is, in general, the recommended solution for VPC to on-premise connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to connect, which integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers/appliances.

. *VPC Peering:* Pair an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC.
+
If the services you are connecting to are hosted on AWS, then you can choose to peer your CloudHub VPC and your AWS VPC.
