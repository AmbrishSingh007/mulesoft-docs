= About Proxies (Nov 2017)

You use a proxy to manage your API without having to change its implementation and to prevent attacks on the server. API Manager auto-generates the proxy when you configure the API as an endpoint with a proxy. Mule Runtime is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application. API Manager automatically generates the proxy app and includes an auto-discovery element in the app. Exception: Auto-generated proxies and deployment from API Manager are not supported using Mule 4 Early Access. After you deploy the app, Mule Runtime 3.x and earlier calls API Manager using the environment client id and secret to gets the policies for the API.

== Mule 3.x Proxies 

// Nov 2017: After you deploy the app, Mule Runtime calls API Manager using the business group client id and secret to get the policies for the API. 

Mule locks the API until all policies have been applied. The client app (consumer) calls the proxy which forwards the call to the API.

In most cases, the proxy you generate in API Manager is suitable for deployment out of the box. However, you can modify the proxy to log data to a file or send data to a Splunk account with the Anypoint Splunk Connector, for example. 

You can import a proxy that you download from API Manager into Studio as a Mule Deployable Archive. You can then modify the proxy in Studio.

If you configured an endpoint with a proxy to use the HTTPS scheme, you need to modify a proxy to add HTTPS credentials.

Download and configure a proxy for auto-discovery as described in the topic linked below.
