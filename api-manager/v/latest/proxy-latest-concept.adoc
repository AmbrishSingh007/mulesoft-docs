= About Mule 4 Proxies (Nov 2017)

A proxy is an application that manages your API so you don't have to modify the API to protect your web service from attacks. The proxy provides protection. Mule Runtime hosts a Mule proxy application. There is a proxy type for each type of web service:

* RAML Proxy
* WSDL Proxy
* HTTP Proxy
* HTTPS Proxy

In Mule 4 Early Access, API Manager does _not_ generate proxies automatically. You need to download the proxy and modify it. In Mule 4 Early Access deployment from API Manager is _not_ supported. 

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is not supported for proxy authentication.

Now, you are ready to download and configure a proxy for Mule 4 Early Access.
