= To Set Up the API (Nov 2017)

In this procedure, you put an asset in place in Exchange, or you design and publish an API to Exchange. You manage the API from API Manager.

. Create an API asset in, or design and publish one to, Exchange:
+
* WSDL, HTTP, or HTTPS: In Exchange, create an API asset, selecting the asset type that corresponds to the type of proxy. See link below.
* RAML: In Design Center, create an API Specification and publish it to Exchange.
. In API Manager, click Manage API > Manage API From Exchange, and configure management of the proxy asset. See link below.
+
. Specify that you are using Mule 4 by checking this box: Check This Box If You Are Managing This Api In Mule 4. The checkbox is located at the bottom of API Configurations as shown in the following RAML, SOAP, and HTTP configuration screenshots:

The API dashboard contains the API ID that you need later. For example:

Now, you are ready to download the proxy.
