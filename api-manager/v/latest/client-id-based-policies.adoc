= Client ID-Based Policies (Nov 2017 and Jul 2017)
:keywords: sla, portal, raml

API Manager provides several client ID-based policies:

* Client-ID Enforcement
* Rate Limiting - SLA-Based
* Throttling - SLA-Based

If you want to track application access to your API, apply one of these policies to handle client ID authentication. Ensure that your application provides its client ID and client secret in every request made to your API. By default, the credentials are expected as query parameters. To prevent user requests from being rejected, create a trait in the RAML root and then reference this trait in every operation of your API. In the list of policies on the API Manager API dasboard, the RAML snippet link contains the RAML code you need to add to the RAML.

== Client ID Enforcement Policy

When registering an application in an Exchange portal (Nov 2017) or API portal (Jul 2017), client app developers obtain credentials, the client ID and client secret, that you configured when applying the policy.

The Client ID Enforcement policy simply enforces the requirement for credentials. Rate Limiting - SLA-Based and Throttling - SLA-Based policies use the client ID as a reference to impose limits on the number of requests that each application can make within a period of time.

== General Client ID-Based Policy Information

The information in these sections applies to all client ID-based policies.

When an application calls an API that enforces a client ID-based policy, API Manager expects client_id and client_secret from the application in the form of query parameters. By default, the query parameters are in the format of <<Required Fields in API Calls, client id and client secret expressions>>. Alternatively, you can remove the client_secret expression and provide only the client_id in the dialog that appears when you apply a client id-regulating policy. In that case, the only a client ID is required.

You can also select HTTP Basic Authorization Header to use Basic Authentication as the origin of the credentials.

=== Registering Applications

Users need to send a token in addition to an ID with every request to an API that enforces client id-Based policies. To obtain the ID and token, client app developers request API access using the Request API Access control on the portal for the API.

After users click Request API Access, they are prompted toÂ select an existing application or create a new one. The request for API access can be automatically approved or, in the case of an client ID-, SLA-based policy, require approval by an admin of the API.

Approve API access requests from Applications on the API dashboard. 

=== Required Fields in API Calls

Use expressions to pass query parameters, client_id and client_secret, from an application to an API that enforces a client ID-based policy:

[source,code,linenums]
----
#[message.inboundProperties['client_id']]
#[message.inboundProperties['client_secret']]
----

You can change this expression to expect these values in any other element in the Mule Message.
