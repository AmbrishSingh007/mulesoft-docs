= To Create an API Instance (Nov 2017)

In the latest API Manager, you can use instances of an API in multiple environments, and you can have multiple instances in the same environment. You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint. You can apply caching policies, for example to the proxy, and throttling policies and security policies to the basic endpoint. 

After setting up an API version for management, you repeat the process to create another instance. Attempting to set up the same version creates another instance of the version. You can create multiple instances and expand the version information to view details about them:

For example, set up version 1.0 of an API named jsonplaceholder.

. Repeat the process to set up an instance:
+
* In API Name, select the same API from Exchange, for example jsonplaceholder. 
* In API Version, select the same version of the API, for example 1.0.
* In Asset Version, select the Exchange asset version.
* In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy. For example, select Endpoint With Proxy.
* In Implementation URI, enter a URI, for example `+http://api.domain.com+`.
+
* Select a proxy deployment target, for example Cloudhub.
* Accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint.
. Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy, or accept the default label, and set a response timeout.
+
. Click API Administration to return to the administration dashboard.
In the Version column, the instance indicator appears beside the version name.
+
. Expand the version.

The instance information appears.
