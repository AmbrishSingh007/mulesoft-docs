= Applying and Editing a CORS Policy (Nov 2017 and Jul 2017)
:keywords: apis, api, cors, policy, headers, group

Cross-origins HTTP requests (CORS) let you request a resource from a different domain. This policy lets you share APIs across domains.

== Applying a CORS Policy

*To apply a CORS policy*:

. Click the version (Nov 2017) or instance (Jul 2017) number of an API.
+
. On the API dashboard, click Policies.
+
The list of any applied policies appears.
+
. In Apply New Policy.
. In Select Policy, choose Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and click Configure Policy.
+
. If this is a public resource, click Apply. If not, uncheck Public Resource.
+
You can't specify a new group until you specify the Default group. The Default group is not a fallback in the normal sense of a default. In this case, it is only the first group you configure for CORs.
+
. To make a credentialed request, click *Support credentials*. For more information, see Mozilla's _Request with credentials_ article, and specify the group:

+
This screenshot shows the UI of the Nov 2017 API Manager. Functionally, the Jul 2017 version is the same.
+
* For the Default group, in Origins, specify one or more domain names, such as *mulesoft.com*. Separate multiple names with commas.
* If needed, change Access Control Max Age to specify how long a preflight request can be cached.
* In Methods, select Methods to govern with the policy.
* In Headers, optionally list headers allowed by the API in the client request.
* In Exposed Headers, optionally list response headers the client can access.
. Click Apply.
