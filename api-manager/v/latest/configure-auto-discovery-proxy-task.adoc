= To Configure the Mule 4 Proxy (Nov 2017)

After downloading a Mule 4 proxy, you are ready to modify the config.properties file. Configure the WSDL, RAML, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy using the following table, which shows the properties by API type that you need to configure in config.properties. The table also includes a property description, unless it's unnecessary and the default values or no default (none). Some properties are not appropriate, and therefore not available (n/a), for certain API types.

| Property: Description | WSDL | RAML | HTTP | HTTPS

| `proxy.port` | 8081 | 8080 | 8080 | 443 
| `proxy.response`: Time (ms) proxy waits for response before throwing timeout | 10000 | n/a | n/a | n/a 
| `implementation.host` | n/a | baseUri.com | baseUri.com | baseUri.com 
| `implementation.port` | n/a | 80 | 80 | 443

| `keystore.key` | n/a | n/a | n/a | Provided when generating keystore 
| `keystore.path` | n/a | n/a | n/a | Provided when generating keystore 
| `wsdl`: Location of wsdl spec | Footnote 2 | n/a | n/a | n/a

*Footnote 1:*

You have to attach your API specification to the RAML proxy and provide a relative or absolute location of the root raml file.

*Footnote 2:*

In this example, the properties in config.properties are service.name, service.name, service.port and the WSDL location is `+http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl+`.

Now, you can deploy the proxy and API Manager will track it.
