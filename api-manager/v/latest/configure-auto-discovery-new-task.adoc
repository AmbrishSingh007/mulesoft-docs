= To Configure Auto-Discovery (Nov 2017)

You include API auto-discovery capability in a Mule application to enable API management from Anypoint Platform on the application HTTP endpoint.

You need to create an instance of an API version before setting up auto-discovery for management of the API. The way you set up auto-discovery depends on the Mule version you use to deploy the API.

* Mule 4
+
Include the API ID-based auto-discovery element in the configuration.xml.
* Mule 3.x
** Include the name and version-based auto-discovery element in the configuration.xml.
** Set up the global auto-discovery element in Studio 6.

This topic describes how to incorporate auto-discovery in your Mule 4 app by setting up the configuration.xml and in your 3.x app by configuring the global auto-discovery element in Studio.

== Configuration XML Element for Mule 4

In Mule 4, the apiId and a reference to the API's main flow identify the API. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. 

. On the API administration dashboard, expand the API version name to display the instances.

+
. Click an instance name.
+
The API ID appears:
+

. Use the following syntax to specify the `apiId` in the configuration.xml:

`<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" />`

For more information about the auto-discovery element for Mule 4 or 3.x, see the auto-discovery reference linked below.

== Studio 6 Configuration for Mule 3.x

In this procedure, you pair Anypoint Studio with an Anypoint Platform environment in your organization by adding environment credentials to Studio Preferences. You configure auto-discovery for each flow you want to manage using a global element. 

A Global Element contains the necessary information for managing an API to Anypoint Platform. Global Elements are then be referenced by one or more endpoints. 

Prepare to use API auto-discovery:

. In Design Center, create an API for each flow you plan to implement in a Mule app.
. In Design Center, publish the APIs in Exchange.
. In API Manager, set the APIs to manage them from Exchange.

Set up auto-discovery:

. In a browser, log in to Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click Access Management > Environments. Click an environment.
+
The environment client ID and client secret appear.
+
. From the Anypoint Studio main menu, select *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Platform for APIs*.
+
The Preferences dialog for Anypoint Platform for APIs appears.
. Copy the environment client ID and client secret from step 1 to Client Credentials.

+
This action pairs Mule Runtime with your Anypoint Platform organization's environment.
+
. Click Validate to verify that the pairing succeeds
+
. In Project Explorer, select the app. For example, select `api.xml` in `src/main/app` that you created in the APIkit tutorial.
. On the Global Elements tab on the canvas, click Create.

+
The Choose Global Type dialog appears.
+
. Select Component Configurations > API Autodiscovery.
+
The Global Element Properties - API Autodiscovery dialog appears.
+
. Create a global element to declare the details of the API version you want Anypoint Platform to discover:
+
* In API Name, type the name of the API that you set up to manage from API Manager.
+
* In API Version, type the version identifier as registered in API Manager, for example `1.0`.
+
* In Flow Name, select the name of the flow in the API to which you want to direct requests. For example, select `api-main`, the APIkit tutorial main flow.
* In APIkit Router Configuration, click api-config from the drop-down in the case of the APIkit tutorial.
+
This configuration is not used by API Manager.
+
* In Description, write some documentation about the API.

. In Project Explorer, right-click the app, `api.xml` in this example, and select Run As > Mule Application.
