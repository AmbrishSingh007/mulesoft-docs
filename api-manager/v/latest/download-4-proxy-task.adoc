= To Download a Mule 4 Proxy (Nov 2017)

After setting up the API, you perform these steps to download the Mule 4 proxy:

. Download the proxy:
+
* Go to the URL in Exchange of the proxy. For example, select one of the following URLs to download a sample of each type of proxy:
** WSDL: `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/api-gateway-sample-wsdl-proxy/+`.
** RAML: `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/api-gateway-sample-raml-proxy/+`
** `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/api-gateway-sample-http-proxy/+`
** `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.examples/api-gateway-sample-https-proxy/+`
* Click Download.
+
. Open the proxy:
+
`unzip proxy.jar -d proxyFolder`
+
. Configure properties in config.properties, located at the root of the proxy folder, as described in the following table.
. Regenerate the JAR using the following command:
+
`zip -r configuredProxy.jar proxyFolder`
+
Include all files _within_ the folder, but do _not_ include the root proxyFolder; otherwise, Mule Runtime rejects the app.
. If you are modifying a RAML or HTTPS proxy, perform the step for that proxy type below:
+
* RAML: Check the exportedResources list in the mule-artifact.json file to make sure the proxy exports all the dependent files of the API specification. If there are any missing files, add them to the mule-artifact.json, and regenerate the JAR.
+

+
* HTTPS: Export your keystore file so it can be used by the proxy listener. This can be done by going to the mule-artifact.json file and completing the exportedResources list:
+
image::mule-artifact-https.png[]

Now, you are ready to configure a Mule 4 proxy.
