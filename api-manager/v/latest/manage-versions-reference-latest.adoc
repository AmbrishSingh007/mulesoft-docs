= About Managing API Versions from Exchange (Nov 2017)

When you publish an API version, Exchange stores it. In Exchange you add, delete, and deprecate versions (aka asset). The additional version can have its own RAML file, API Portal, and URL. In API Manager, you create, import, and deprecate instances of the API.
