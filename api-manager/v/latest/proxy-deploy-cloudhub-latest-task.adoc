= To Deploy a Proxy to CloudHub (Nov 2017)

In API Manager, you can deploy a proxy to CloudHub if you use Mule 3.x Runtime or earlier. From API Manager, deployment using Mule 4 Early Access is not supported.

During the configuration of an API instance, you specify to manage the instance as a basic endpoint or as endpoint with a proxy. If you specify deployment to CloudHub of an endpoint with a proxy, use this deployment procedure.

// What permissions do you need?

After saving the API Configuration you manage from Exchange or you import,  Deployment Configuration appears:

. In Deployment Configuration, in Runtime Version, select a Mule Runtime version. In Proxy Application Name, type a name for the proxy.
. Check Update Application If Exists if you want to redeploy the proxy to Cloudhub. Uncheck this option if you do not want to continue with deployment if the proxy is already deployed. In the latter case, deployment fails.

Deploying to CloudHub, which shows the status of deployment, appears.
