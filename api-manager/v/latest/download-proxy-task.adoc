= To Download a Proxy (Nov 2017)

You use a proxy to manage your API without having to change its implementation and to prevent attacks on the server. Mule Runtime is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application. To deploy an API from Anypoint Platform, you typically generate a proxy application by downloading it. You can manage your API through a proxy without having to change the implementation of the API. This proxy application is sometimes called an auto-generated proxy. 

Auto-generated proxies are not supported on Mule Runtime 4.0 (and Studio 7) in API Manager.
