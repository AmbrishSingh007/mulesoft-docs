= To Download a Proxy (Nov 2017)

You use a proxy to manage your API without having to change its implementation and to prevent attacks on the server. Mule Runtime is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application.  

Auto-generated proxies are not supported on Mule Runtime 4.0 (and Studio 7) in API Manager. If you are using Mule Runtime 3.x, and you have generated a proxy, you can download it by following this procedure.

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
. In API Administration, expand an API version to show its instances.
. Click the name of an instance of an API version.
+
. Select Download Proxy from the Actions dropdown.
