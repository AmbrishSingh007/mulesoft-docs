= API Manager 

API Manager is available in two versions: the Nov 2017 and the Jul 2017 version. If you create an Anypoint Platform account after the November release, you use the Nov 2017 API Manager to manage APIs. Otherwise, you use the Jul 2017 version of API Manager until you upgrade your APIs to the latest Anypoint Platform. Anypoint Platform opens the right version of API Manager for you automatically.

If you have the November 2017 release, use the Design Center to author and update RAML specifications. Deployment to CloudHub occurs automatically as you design an API in Design Center. To deploy an API proxy to other servers, you can use API Manager. In API manager, you govern how users access the API through policies and SLA tiers.
