= About Managing API Versions and Instances from Exchange (Nov 2017)

In this release, after you create an API, in Design Center for example, you set a version name and publish it to Exchange. The version resides in Exchange, not API Manager. You then set up the version for management in API Manager. Management tasks in API Manager include switching the environment and configuring an API endpoint to name a few. In API Manager, you also create, import, and deprecate version instances, not versions themselves.

In Exchange you add, delete, and deprecate API versions, which are called Exchange assets. An API version in Exchange can have its own RAML file, API Portal, and URL.
