= About Managing API Versions and Instances from Exchange (Nov 2017)

When you publish an API to Exchange, Exchange stores the version. You can manage the version in Exchange from API Manager. Management tasks include switching the environment and configuring an API endpoint. In API Manager, you create, import, and deprecate instances of the API version.

In Exchange you add, delete, and deprecate API versions, which are called Exchange assets. The additional API version can have its own RAML file, API Portal, and URL.
