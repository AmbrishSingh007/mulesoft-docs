= API Auto-Discovery Reference (Nov 2017)
:keywords: auto-discovery, autodiscovery, auto-discovery schema, auto-discovery namespace

The configuration.xml of a project that includes auto-discovery references the main flow, where you configure the HTTP listener. From the auto-discovery configuration, API Manager obtains the information necessary to manage the APIs described by the global elements. 

== api-platform-gw Attributes

The `api-platform-gw` global element contains the information needed to register an API in Anypoint Platform. The global element includes the description and tag attributes. The api-platform-gw attributes include the `flowRef` attribute. In an APIkit project, the global element includes an `apikitRef` that references the APIkit global configuration. 

The Nov 2017 API Manager doesn't support the `create` attribute. You need to create an API in API Manager before using auto-discovery.

=== API Manager and Mule 3.x

The following table lists the `api-platform-gw` attributes when you use the Nov 2017 API Manager and Mule 3.x:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Required |Description
|*apiId* |Yes |The friendly API name that appears on API Manager and in Studio on Global Element Properties.
|*flowRef* |Yes |A reference to the main flow of your project. It triggers the agent to discover this flow and use it when performing the auto-registration.
|*apikitRef* |No |A reference to the APIkit configuration. Used to upload the RAML file to Anypoint Platform after API registration completes and for resource level policies.
|*apiName* |Yes |The friendly API name that appears on API Manager and in Studio on Global Element Properties.
|*version* |Yes |The version number. Management breaks if you change the version in API Portal.
|===

API Manager generates the `apiName` and `version` of new APIs managed by API Manager. The name and version are displayed on the API instance dashboard:

If you upgraded a managed API, the existing name and version are preserved to maintain backward compatibility.
The following configuration.xml is an example of an API configured for auto-discovery:

*Mule Runtime 3.x*

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<api-platform-gw:api apiName="${apiName}" version="${apiVersion}" flowRef="proxy" create="true" apikitRef="api-config" doc:name="API Autodiscovery">
  <api-platform-gw:description>Consume site statistics and perform Q3 computations</api-platform-gw:description>
  <api-platform-gw:tag>Q3results</api-platform-gw:tag>
</api-platform-gw:api>
----


=== API Manager and Mule 4 

The following table lists the `api-platform-gw` attributes when you use the Nov 2017 API Manager and Mule 4:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Attribute |Required |Description
|*apiId* |Yes |The friendly API name that appears on API Manager and in Studio on Global Element Properties.
|*flowRef* |Yes |A reference to the main flow of your project. It triggers the agent to discover this flow and use it when performing the auto-registration.
|*apikitRef* |No |A reference to the APIkit configuration. Used to upload the RAML file to Anypoint Platform after API registration completes and for resource level policies.
|===

API Manager generates the `apiId` of new APIs managed by API Manager. The API ID is displayed on the API instance dashboard:

image::api-id.png[]

The following configuration.xml is an example of an API configured for auto-discovery in Mule Runtime 4.x:

*Mule Runtime 4.x*

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<api-platform-gw:api apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" doc:name="API Autodiscovery" />
----

In Mule Runtime 4.x, `create`, `apikitRef` attributes and `description`, `tag` elements were removed.


=== New API Manager and Mule 3.x or Mule 4

The other auto-discovery elements are consistent from Mule releases 3.x to 4.

==== api-platform-gw Nested Elements

The following attributes list the `api-platform-gw` nested elements.

[%header,cols="34a,33a,33a"]
|===
|Nested Element |Required |Description
|*api-platform-gw:description* |No |A description of the API that appears on the API version details page when Anypoint Platform discovers and registers the API.
|*api-platform-gw:tag* |No |The tag is searchable metadata in the API Manager and API that appears on the API version details page when Anypoint Platform discovers and registers the API.
