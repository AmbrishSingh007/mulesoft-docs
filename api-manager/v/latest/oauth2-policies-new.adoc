= About OAuth 2 Policies (Nov 2017)

The OAuth Token Enforcement policy protects the API by restricting client app access. Unless the policy validates the access token it receives, access is denied. The token is not defined on the OAuth provider, it has been granted by it.

An authorization enforcement policy, which you apply to an API in Anypoint Platform, connects to an OpenAM authorization server, an OpenID Connect Token Introspection endpoint, PingFederate authorization server, or a custom OAuth 2.0 provider. See link below. 

*Recommendation:* Use an OpenAM authorization server, an OpenID Connect Token Introspection endpoint, or PingFederate authorization server instead of a custom OAuth Provider.

You can use only a custom Mule Auth 2.0 provider with the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy. Use the general procedure for applying policies to apply an OAuth 2 policy. See link below.

== Prerequisites

* You are an Anypoint Platform organization administrator or have permission to create or manage APIs in an environment.
* You set up your Anypoint Platform organization as a federated organization using either OpenAM, OpenID Connect, or PingFederate. See link below. Alternatively, you have a Mule OAuth 2.0 provider configured and running.


== Access Scopes

When you apply the policy, you can configure access scopes if you use any one of the OAuth 2.0 policies provided in API Manager. Enter a space-separated list of strings that indicate the scopes that API is allowed to access. The scopes are case-sensitive and need to match those defined in your OAuth Provider.

== Access Token 

OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy requires the Access Token validation endpoint url, which defines the service that will be called to validate the access token.

== Obtaining User Credentials

Federation policies enrich the flow with user information stored in the OAuth Provider that can be used for user verification. This information is accessible from attributes.headers in Mule 4 or higher or outbound properties in earlier version. The elements that provide the information depend on the grant type used to retrieve the token.

* The user ID is X-AGW-userid for these grant types:
** Resource Owner Credentials
** Implicit
** Authorization Code
* The user ID is X-AGW-client_id for the Client Credentials grant type.

This information is available to be referenced and used internally in your proxy by any component that follows it in the flow.

All user information enriched by the policy has the "X-AGW-" prefix.

== Deployments under Mule 3.x and Earlier 

The HTTP Connector that generates the proxy output transforms any received outbound properties into HTTP message headers that  were returned to the requester.
User information can be accessed from a map. Use MEL expressions to access the flow variable that contains the map `['_agwUser']`. If you want to access a particular value of the map you could use this expression, for example:

`#[flowVars['_agwUser']['uid']]`

== Deployments under Mule 4

Policies that are called after the federated OAuth 2 policy, or in a flow, can use the `Authentication.properties` object. This object contains the following elements:

* Raw response message
+
`#[authentication.properties.tokenContext]`
+
* Access Token
+
`#[authentication.properties.accessToken]`
* OAuth Provider response headers
+
#[authentication.properties.userProperties]

If you configure the policy to expose headers, information from this object arrives at the backend API as headers.

== Token Validation Response Example

The following example shows HTTP message headers returned as a token validation response.

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2015 19:08:07 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Server: Restlet-Framework/2.1.1
Vary: Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Accept
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
{"uid":"john.doe","mail":"john.doe@example.com","scope":["uid","mail","cn","givenName"],"grant_type":"password","cn":"John Doe Full","realm":"/","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":580,"givenName":"John","access_token":"fa017a0e-1bd5-214c-b19d-03efe9f9847e"}
----

This token validation response may vary and, if Expose Headers is enabled, the proxy sends all headers received to the backend implementation with the following exceptions:

* `scope`
* `expires_in nodes`
