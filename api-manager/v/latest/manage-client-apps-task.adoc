= To Manage Client Applications

In Exchange, you can make information about APIs you develop in Anypoint Platform publicly available for applications that want to consume the API. You can limit access to certain users. 

The applications you grant access are listed on API Manager > Client Applications. To see the Client Applications link from all Business Groups, you need to be an Organization Administrator.

Select an app name to view app information and access the following controls for removing the app (revoking access), resetting the client ID and client secret, and adding or removing app owners:

== To Remove an Application

As Organization Administrator, to delete an application that you gave access to your API:

. Click API Manager > Client Applications. 
. Select the name of the application to delete. 
. Click Delete image:trash.png[trash icon].

This action deletes any granted access to that application from the API portal.

== To Access an Application Client ID and Client Secret

As Organization Administrator, after you approve a client app to access your API, you can access information about the app from API Manager > Client Applications. You can view and reset the unique client ID and client secret for the application. When calling the API, the client app owner needs to pass these credentials if the API is protected with policies. 

== To Change SLA Tiers

The following options describe the various ways that you and/or an API Owner can change the SLA tier that your application is contracted to use.

* If you requested access to a tier and have not yet been approved for that tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier and your request for access is automatically updated to the new tier.
* If you have been approved for a tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier. If the new tier requires manual approval, you need to wait for the API Owner to change your tier per your request.
* If you were previously approved for an SLA tier and your access to that tier was revoked, you can reapply for access to a tier. The API Owner can then restore your access and adjust the tier.
* If you were approved for an SLA tier and that tier is deprecated by the API Owner, you can apply for access to a non-deprecated tier. The API Owner can then change your tier per your request.
* The API Owner can also change your tier without a change request from you.

== To Access APIs Protected by OAuth Token Enforcement

When you work in an organization that uses PingFederate, OpenID Connect or OpenAM for identity management, you need to supply additional information to develop your application. Register your application on Anypoint Platform to obtain a client ID and client secret and register them in the federated orgnaization, and work with your organization administrator to get necessary OAuth information.

When you register applications for access to APIs in a federated organization, you need to provide an OAuth Grant Type, Application URL, and OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI.
