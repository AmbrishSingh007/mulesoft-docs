= To Deploy a Proxy to a Hybrid Environment (Nov 2017)

In API Manager, you can deploy a proxy to a hybrid server if you use Mule 3.8 Runtime or API Gateway 2.x. From API Manager, deployment using Mule 4 Early Access is not supported.

When you configure an API instance, you choose to manage the instance as a basic endpoint or as endpoint with a proxy. If you choose Endpoint With A Proxy > Hybrid, use this deployment procedure. 

To perform this procedure you need to meet the following prerequisites:

// what permissions do  you need?

* Completion of API configuration.
* Access to a Mule Runtime that has been configured to pair with your organization in the case of a private server. 
* You need to register your private server with Mule Agent 1.9.0 to deploy the API to a hybrid target.

After saving the API Configuration you manage from Exchange or you import,  Deployment Configuration appears:


. In Deployment Configuration, in Hybrid Target, select the private server you registered with Mule Agent 1.9.0.
. Click Deploy.
. If you chose HTTPS for the scheme of the deployment, complete the steps to build HTTPS services.
