API Analytics can provide insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. From API Manager, you can access the Analytics dashboard, create a custom dashboard, create and manage charts, and create reports. From API Manager, you can get following types of analytics:

* link:/api-manager/viewing-api-analytics[Viewing Analytics]
* link:/api-manager/analytics-event-api[Analytics Event API]
* link:/api-manager/analytics-chart[Analytics Chart in API Manager]

You can view data from a policy perspective in the Analytics dashboard, Analytics chart, or API Manager by including policy violations. This action tracks traffic rejected, or not rejected, by a policy. 

From the API Manager 1.x, you can also get link:/api-manager/api-consumer-analytics[API Consumer Analytics].
