= To Grant Permission to Access Environments

A permission called API Manager Environment Administrator gives users full access to API Manager operations inside environments. API Manager environment administrator only relates to actions inside of API Manager.

API Manager also supports additional environment granular permissions:

* *Deploy API Proxies* - Deploy or redeploy an API proxy - Requires Runtime Manager and 
Hybrid access. This role enables deployment access from the API Manager, but cannot 
guarantee that deployment is successful due to its dependency on Runtime Manager or Hybrid. 
* *Manage Alerts* - Create, edit, and delete alerts.
* *Manage APIs Configuration* - Create APIs and import APIs from Exchange. This permission also 
lets a user promote an API to another environment, edit the configuration of an API, and delete
APIs.
* *Manage Contracts* - Deploy, reject, and revoke contracts.
* *Manage Policies* - Create, edit, delete, enable, and disable a policy. Also lets a user edit the order of policies.
* *View Alerts* - List alerts and view configuration summary of an alert.
* *View APIs Configuration* - List APIs, view configuration summary of an API, and download proxies.
* *View Contracts* - List contracts and their configuration. Can also list SLA tiers and their configuration.
* *View Policies* - View a listing of policies and view the configuration of a policy.

These permissions are for an environment, not for an API, and only relate to actions inside API Manager.

The relationships of the permissions are as follows:

The outer permissions provide permission to the inner permissions. For example, Manage Alerts gives permission to View Alerts and to View API Configuration.

After you select the permissions, click the blue plus icon image:blue-plus.png[blue plus icon].

For the API Manager Environment Administration role, be judicious as some very limited roles don't make sense to assign the responsibilty of this role.

== To Assign Roles

. In Access Management > Roles, select a role from the list of roles defined for your organization. 
+
In Permissions, the following categories of permissions you can grant to the selected role appear:
+
* APIs
* API Manager
* Runtime Manager
* Data Gateway
* Design Center
+
If these categories do not appear, the role you selected doesn't support granting these types of permissions. Select a different role.
+
. Select API Manager.
. In Environment, click inside the text entry box.
+
A list of environments defined for your organization appears.
+
. Select an environment.
+
. In Permissions, select API Manager Environment Administration.
. Select image:blue-plus.png[].
. Repeat the last three steps to grant permission to multiple environments:
* In Environment, select another environment.
* In Permissions, select API Manager Environment Administration.
* Select image:blue-plus.png[].
+

Now, you can do the following things:

* Create and modify your APIs as well as modifying those created by others
* Apply policies
* Define SLAs
* Create alerts
