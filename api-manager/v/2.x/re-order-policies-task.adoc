= To Re-order Policies

In Mule Runtime 4.x, which policies run first is configurable with the exception of CORS. This procedure describes how to re-order policies provided by Anypoint Platform other than CORS. CORS has the highest precedence. You cannot set other policies at a higher level. You can set the order of execution of policies for a custom policy by configuring the policy tag or the before or after blocks.

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager, and in API Administration, click the API version or instance.

. On the API dashboard, choose Policies.

. In the top of the list of any applied policies, click Edit Policy Order to change the priority.
