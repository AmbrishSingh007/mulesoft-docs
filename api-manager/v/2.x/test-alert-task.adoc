= To Test an Alert (Nov 2017 and Jul 2017)

This procedure describes how to test a request count alert. This procedure requires the following preparation:

. Design an API.
. If you use the Nov 2017 API Manager, perform these steps; otherwise, skip these steps and go straight to deployment.
* Publish the API to Exchange. 
* In API Manager, manage the API from Exchange.
. Deploy a proxy of the API instance (Nov 2017) or version (Jul 2017) to CloudHub.
. Apply the Rate Limiting Policy to the API as follows: Request Count greater than 1 for at least 1 consecutive minute.
+
. Add the alert described in the topic about how to add an alert.
. Call the API.
+
. Recall the API two more times (reload the page). Check that `API calls exceeded` appears if you called and recalled the API within the 1 minute period. Any additional page reload operations within the 1 minute period have no effect.
. Check that users, who you selected for email notification when you added the alert, actually receive email notifications.
. Check that the alert was resolved.
