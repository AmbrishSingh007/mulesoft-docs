= API Manager 2.x

API Manager 2.x was released in Nov 2017. If you create an Anypoint Platform account after the November release, you use API Manager 2.x to manage APIs. Otherwise, you use the API Manager 1.x until you upgrade your APIs to the latest Anypoint Platform. Anypoint Platform opens the right version of API Manager for you automatically.

If you have the November 2017 release, use Design Center to author and update RAML specifications. Deployment to CloudHub occurs automatically as you design an API in Design Center. To deploy an API proxy to other servers, you can use API Manager. In API manager, you govern how users access the API through policies and SLA tiers.
