:keywords: header, policy

API Manager supports several policies for injecting or removing HTTP headers from a request or response. The policies take effect before sending the request or response.

The add request header policy injects one or more headers into a request from the client to the backend service, or overrides the value of an existing header.
The remove request header policy prevents receipt of one or more specified headers sent from the client to the backend service.

The add response header policy injects one or more headers into a response from the backend service to the client, or overrides the header value in a response from the backend service.
The remove response header policy prevents inclusion of one or more specified headers in a response from the backend service to the client.
