Contains the canvas in which you can see a visual representation of your flows. You can drag and drop Event Processors from the Mule Palette into the canvas to add them to your flow. +
Clicking an Event Processor in the canvas opens up the Mule Properties View with the attributes for the selected processor, allowing you to edit them.


* The Global Elements tab
