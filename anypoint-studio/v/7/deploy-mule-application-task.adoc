= To Deploy a Mule Applcation to CloudHub (Anypoint Studio)

. Right click the project folder on your Package Explorer View.
. Select Anypoint Platform and then Deploy to CloudHub.
+
If you don't have your Anypoint Platform credentials configured in Anypoint Studio, you'll need to provide your log in information before continuing.
. Configure the CloudHub instance to which your application is being deployed. +
// You can specify a name for the application. This name is part of the domain of your deployed app. By default, Studio uses your package name as the domain for the application. +
// You can also configure the runtime version. By default, Studio uses the application version you are using in your project during development. +
// To reduce compatibility risks, you should always deploy to the runtime version in which your Mule project is created or the closest alternative. +
// Additionally you can also configure the amount of worker and worker size for the CloudHub instance you are going to use, enable Insight, static IPs, configure log levels and properties placeholders for your application.
