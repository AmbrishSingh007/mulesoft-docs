= About Editors, Views, and Perspectives

An Editor in Anypoint Studio is a visual component used to design and edit a resource. They allow you to edit:

* Mule configuration files.
* API definitions.
* Properties files.
* A pom.xml file to handle dependencies.

Views in  Studio are also visual components, and they show a graphical representation of project metadata, or display properties for the active editor. +
For example, the package explorer view presents a graphical representation of the folders and files associated with your Mule project, and the Mule Properties view presents a graphical representation of a component selected in your Studio canvas.

Other popular views in Studio are:

* Console
* Error Log
* Mule Palette
* Package Explorer
* Mule Properties
* Mule Debugger

A Perspective in Studio is a collection of Views and Editors in a given arrangement. +
The default Studio perspective is the Mule Design Perspective. Studio comes also bundled with a Mule Debug Perspective.
