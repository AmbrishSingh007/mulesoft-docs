= BAT CLI Reference

The BAT CLI provides a command line utility that you can use to run tests locally and schedule monitors for continuous API testing. You can schedule tests in the cloud using the CLI-xAPI.  The BAT CLI is integrated with Anypoint Platform.

This reference covers the syntax and key options you can use with the BAT command. Using the BAT command, you debug and run tests, get credentials for scheduling tests, schedule tests, list test schedules, and perform other operations.

*NAME*

bat - the API functional monitoring command line interface

*SYNOPSIS*

`bat [<file> ... | <option> ...]`

`bat [login --username=<value> [--profile=<value>] --host=<value>]`

This option displays an interactive command for the password.

** `password for user [username]: <password>`

Optionally, you can include the option `--password=<password>` in the login command.

Where:

* file is the relative path to the path and file name. The file must have one of the following base names and one of the following extensions:
+
** base file names: main, bat
** extensions: .yaml, or .yml
+
When you execute bat without any arguments, it reads the YAML in the current directory and runs the specified tests.
You can create a config folder and create different configuration files for the environments.

```
test-project
├── bat.yaml
├── tests
└── config
    ├── default
    ├── devx
    ├── qax
    ├── stgx
    └── prod

```

The options are:

* `bat ~/path/to/folder/` +
Executes the desired folder. BAT searches for and executes the `bat.yaml` and `main.dwl` files.

* `bat ./folder/file.dwl` +
Executes the desired file. The root of the project is the current folder.
The root of the project is used to resolve imports, and load libraries and files.

* `bat --validate` +
Validates the syntax and grammar of the project.

* `bat --config=dev` +
Executes loading a configuration from the  `./config/dev.dwl` file,
and injecting the result in a input called `config`.

* `bat --version` +
Lists the current version to the standard output.

* `bat --update` +
Updates the software to the latest version of BAT
and configures a `.bat-version` file in the current folder.
BAT respects the `.bat-version` configuration to run the tests.
If the specified version is missing, it is downloaded before execution.

The command `bat init` sets up a basic project folder. The folder contains the following files:
```
bat.yaml
tests/
tests/HelloWorld.dwl
config/
config/default.dwl
config/prod.dwl
config/dev.dwl
```

== BAT Command Examples

* Run multiple test files that are listed in bat.yaml.
+
`bat bat.yaml`
+
* Run a single file.
+
`bat ./test/myFile.dwl`
* Determine the installed version.
+
`bat --version`
+
Example output if you do not have the latest version is:
+
