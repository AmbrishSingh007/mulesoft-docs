= About API Functional Monitoring

You use API functional monitoring to run a test or suite of tests on an API. You can automate testing and get reports. Using API functional monitoring, you can test before pushing code into your repository and before deploying to production. Tests can verify API functionality and validate results the API generates. You can monitor APIs at each stage of the software development life cycle and in production.
