= APIkit 4.x Overview

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

If you’re an APIkit 3.x user, you can get up and running quickly with APIkit 4.0. Basic use hasn’t changed. APIkit 4.0 supports Mule Runtime 4.0 features, such as error handling.

The Enterprise Edition of APIkit uses DataWeave for generating a mocked implementation that simulates calls to the API based on the examples provided in a RAML definition.

APIkit 4.x removes the following APIkit properties that APIkit 3.x had:

* `consolePath`
* `consoleEnabled`

The API folder is located under resources. API definition files are no longer duplicated in the root folder.
