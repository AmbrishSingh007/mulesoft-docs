= APIkit 4.x Overview

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

If you’re an APIkit 3.x user, you can get up and running quickly with APIkit 4.x. Basic use hasn’t changed. Key improvements and changes in this release are:

* APIkit is now a Mule plugin. 
+
** MuleSoft can update APIkit in a timely manner, independent from Mule Runtime updates.
** To use a different APIkit version, just change the dependency in the POM.
+
* API Console 4.0 that simulates calls to the API is not embedded in Studio.
* Some APIkit XML elements and attributes changed. The Mule project structure changed.
* Error handling aligns with Mule Runtime 4.0.

You can also change the host, port, path, and scheme by editing the listener and listener-config.

The Enterprise Edition of APIkit uses DataWeave for generating a mocked implementation that simulates calls to the API based on the examples provided in a RAML definition.

APIkit 4.x removes the following APIkit properties that APIkit 3.x had:

* `consolePath`
* `consoleEnabled`

The API folder is located under resources. API definition files are no longer duplicated in the root folder.

== APIkit Distribution

In Studio, you use the installation wizard to check for updates. The timing of future improvements and fixes are no longer constrained by Studio or Mule Runtime release schedules.

To change an APIkit version, just change the dependency in the POM of your application with the latest version of the module.
