= To Consume a REST Service
:keywords: api, raml, json

*For the latest docs, see https://beta-apikit4.docs-stgx.mulesoft.com/*

This procedure uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+` for example purposes.  The JSONPlaceholder service provides user information in JSON format. You download a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio based on the RAML. You run the API as a Mule app and view the RAML code.

. Prepare RAML code for importing into Studio. 
* From the "Download" section at the end of this topic, download the ZIP file containing the RAML API specification and JSON example code. 
* Unzip the file.
. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*.
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* Select a RAML specification from the file system. Select Browse Files. Browse to and select the `api.raml` that you downloaded.

+
When you finish, Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources appear.

The RAML file and the user-example.json file referenced by the RAML that you imported appears in `src/main/resources/api`.

+
. Click Run As image:lrun_obj.png[run icon] > Mule Application.
+
The application deploys and you can now simulate calling the API using APIkit Console or view the RAML code.
+
. Open a terminal, and enter a curl command to view the RAML code of the API specification, and then enter a curl command to view the contents of the included file:
+
* `+curl http://localhost:8081/console/api/?raml+`
+
* `+curl http://localhost:8081/console/api/user-example.json?raml+`
