= Workflow: Creating, Testing, and Implementing an API
:keywords: api, raml, json

This workflow uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+` for example purposes.  The JSONPlaceholder service provides user information in JSON format. You design a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio based on the RAML. You simulate calls to the API, and add logic to implement the project as a Mule app.

+
Prepares the RAML code and dependent example file for importing into Studio as an APIkit project. Alternatively, you can use a text editor instead of Design Center to create .raml and .json files presented in this topic.
+
. Start the APIkit project by importing the API specification.
. Run the APIkit project.
. View the code for the API.
. Simulate the API.
. Implement the API:
+
* Implement the endpoint to the JsonPlaceholder service.
* Add logic to filter users by ID.
* Add a service to get only names of users.
. Test the API.

== To Start an APIkit Project

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*.
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* Select the RAML specification from Design Center.

Alternatively, you can select Browse Files. Browse to and select the `api.raml` that you downloaded.

+
When you finish, Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources appear.

+
The RAML file and the user-example.json file referenced by the RAML that you imported appears in `src/main/resources/api`.

Now, you are ready to test the API.

== To Run an APIkit Project 

This procedure assumes you started an APIkit project and are ready to simulate calling the API.

. Click Run As image:lrun_obj.png[run icon] > Mule Application.
+
The application deploys and you can now simulate calling the API using APIkit Console or view the RAML code.

== To View Code of the API Specification and Dependent Files

. Open a terminal, and enter a curl command to view the RAML code of the API specification, and then enter a curl command to view the contents of the included file:
+
* `+curl http://localhost:8081/console/api/?raml+`
+
* `+curl http://localhost:8081/console/api/user-example.json?raml+`
