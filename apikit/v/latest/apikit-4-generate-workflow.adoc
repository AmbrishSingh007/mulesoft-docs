= Workflow: Creating, Testing, and Implementing an API
:keywords: api, raml, json

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

This workflow uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+` for example purposes.  The JSONPlaceholder service provides user information in JSON format. You design a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio based on the RAML. You simulate calls to the API, and add logic to implement the project as a Mule app. Resources are:

 * All user information
 * Information about user having ID = _n_

+
Prepares the RAML code and dependent example file for importing into Studio as an APIkit project. Alternatively, you can use a text editor instead of Design Center to create .raml and .json files presented in this topic.
+
. Start the APIkit project by importing the API specification.
. Run the APIkit project.
. Simulate the API.
. Implement the API:
+
* Implement the endpoint to the JsonPlaceholder service.
* Add logic to filter users by ID.
* Add a service to get only names of users.
. Test the API.
