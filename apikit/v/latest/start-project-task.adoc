= To Start an APIkit Project

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

In this procedure, you import the RAML into Studio that you created in Design Center or in a text editor.

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*.
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* In API Definition, select Design Center, login to Anypoint Platform if necessary, and select the api.raml you created in the last task.

Alternatively, if you didn't create the RAML in Design Center, select Browse Files.

Browse to and select the `api.raml` that you created in a text editor.

+
The api.raml and the included user-example.json file are imported into the project.
+
When you finish, Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources appear.

The RAML file and the user-example.json file referenced by the RAML that you imported appears in `src/main/resources/api`.
