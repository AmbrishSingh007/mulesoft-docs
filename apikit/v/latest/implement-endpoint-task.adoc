= To Implement the Endpoint

Implementation of the API:
HTTP listener & APIkit Router
Error handling
API Console
Flows (mock implementation)
After simulating calls to the API, prepare the API for release. Modify and add flows that return actual data from the JSON Placeholder site instead of the data from RAML examples. Modify the users flow to get actual data from the Json Placeholder site:

. Drag an HTTP component to the Source section of the get:/users:api-config flow.
. In the properties editor of the HTTP Listener, change the Path from `/` to */placeholder*.
. In Connector Configuration of the HTTP Listener, click image:Edit-16x16.gif[Edit-16x16] and click OK to accept the default host 0.0.0.0 and port 8081.
. Delete the Set Payload component from the Process area of the get:/users:api-config flow.
. Drag an HTTP connector to the Process area of the flow.
. In the properties editor of the HTTP Requester, set the following options:
+
* Path: `/users`
+
* Method: Select GET from the drop-down.
+
. In Connector Configuration of the HTTP Requester, click image:Add-16x16.png[Add-16x16].
+
The HTTP Request Configuration dialog appears.
+
. Set the following HTTP Request Configuration options:
+
* Accept the default Name, HTTP_Request_Configuration.
* Accept the default HTTP protocol.
* Set Host to *jsonplaceholder.typicode.com*.
* Set Port to 80.
+
. Save changes.

== To Filter Users By ID Using a Parameter

* All user information
* Information about user having ID = _n_

Revise the flow to filter users by ID:

. Drag an HTTP component to the Source section of the get:/users/userbyid:api-config flow.
. In the properties editor, set Path to */placeholder/byid*.
. In Connector Configuration of the HTTP Listener, click image:Edit-16x16.gif[Edit-16x16] and click OK to accept the default host 0.0.0.0 and port 8081.
. Delete Set Payload from the flow, and in its place, drag an HTTP component to the Process area.
. In the properties editor, set the following HTTP Requester options:
* Path: Set to */users*.
* Method: Select GET from the drop-down.
* Click Add Parameter and set the following options:
+
** Name: *id*
** Value to *#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.id]*
. Save.
