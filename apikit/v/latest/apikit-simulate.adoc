= To Simulate API Calls

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

Simulating calls to the API is a critical design task that helps you troubleshoot problems and demo the API to prospective users even before you have implemented it. To simulate calls to the API, you can include the following things in the definition of a RAML resource:

An example of data the actual implementation would return

An HTTP status code the API returns if successful

You can use the mocking service in API Console to provide a base URI for an API you havenâ€™t implemented yet. When you simulate a successful call to the API, the mocking service returns the status code 200 and example data.

You see the response example from the JSON example when you preview the resource that includes the example.

The Enterprise Edition of APIkit uses DataWeave for generating a mocked implementation that simulates calls to the API based on the examples provided in a RAML definition.

In this procedure, you enter the URL for API Console in a browser to simulate calls to the API. You can simulate a RESTful API to consume a JSON resource and filter user information. This procedure assumes you just finished running an APIkit API as a Mule application. 

. In Studio, click the Console tab, and scroll up through the logs to find the API Console URL.

. In a browser, go to the API Console URL.

The API Console appears showing the version information for the API.

. Click the hamburger menu to display simulation controls for API resources.

+
. In API Summary, click GET for the `/users` resource.
+
The HTTP 200 response indicating success and the JSON example you expect for the `/users` resource appears.

+
. In API Summary, click the `users` resource to see documentation about methods and sub-resources. 
. In API Summary, expand `/userbyid`. Click GET for the `/usersbyid` resource, and click Try It.
+
Parameters and Headers tabs appear where you can add query parameters and headers to requests.
+
. Check Show Optional Parameters, and click Send.
+
The HTTP 200 response indicating success appears. The JSON example for the `/usersbyid` resource, which is the user information for the user having id 3, appears.

. Hover over the controls in the Details section to see what you can do with the content of the simulation: 
+
* Copy content to clipboard
* Save content to file
* View with highlighted syntax
* Preview response
* Wrap or unwrap text

Now, you are ready to implement the endpoint.
