= To Validate Query Parameters and Headers

*Documentation for APIkit 4.x*

This procedure assumes that you have generated Mule flows using APIkit in Studio. You configure APIkit Router to validate, or not, headers and query parameters. Strict query parameter and header validation limits parameters to those defined in the RAML. Enabling validations can affect performance. Many complex validations can cause a delay in response time, so if your use case cannot tolerate latency, you might want to disable validations. By default validations are disabled.

. In Studio, select APIkit Router.

. Check Query Parameters Strict Validations to limit parameters to those defined in the RAML.
. Check Headers Strict Validations to limit headers to those defined in the RAML.
. Reverse the procedure in steps 3 and 4 (uncheck options) to inhibit the respective validation, or check Disable Validations to inhibit both validations.
