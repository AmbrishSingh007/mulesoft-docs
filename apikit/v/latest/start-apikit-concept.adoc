= About Starting an APIkit Project

In Studio, you can start an APIkit project in several ways:

* File > New > Mule Project, check Add APIkit Components.
* File > New > Mule Project, check Add APIkit Components, and enter an API definition file location or URL.
* Create the RAML file within an existing Studio project (called a backend-first APIkit design).

The API definition file is a RAML or WSDL. When you check Add APIkit Components but don't import or reference an API definition file, APIkit generates a skeletal RAML file and XML configuration that includes the following things:

* HTTP Listener configuration
* APIkit Router component
* Error handlers

When you check Add APIkit Components and do import or reference an API definition file, APIkit includes the following things depending on the type of API definition file:

* RAML
+
** HTTP Listener configuration
** APIkit Router component
** Error handlers
** RAML dependencies
+
Push or pull changes from one location, such as Studio, to the other, such as Design Center.
+
* Backend flows containing REST resource-action mappings
+
* WSDL
+
** Everything listed above
** A main flow with an HTTP Listener
** A SOAP Router
** A SOAP fault response template
** Backend flows containing SOAP message templates.

Use a SOAP testing tool, such as SoapUI, to simulate calls to the API. If you change the WSDL, regenerate backend flows using Mule > Generate SOAP Flows.
