= External Functions Available In DataWeave
:keywords: lookup, properties, functions

A number of functions are available in addition to DataWeave's, provided by both
 the Mule Runtime and Modules/Connectors in your app.
These functions can be used within DataWeave scripts and provide functionally beyond the
language, specific to the component exposing them.

== Mule Runtime Functions

These functions are always available since they are injected by the Mule Runtime.

=== Accessing Properties (`p` Function)

The `p` function provides access to properties, whether these are:

* Mule property placeholders
* System properties
* Environment properties

You can read more on configuring properties and how they are handled link:configuring-properties[here].

The following example will log the value of the property `some.property`.

.Example: Property Function Usage
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="simple">
  <logger message="#[p('some.property')]"/>
</flow>
----

=== Executing a Flow (`lookup` Function)

The `lookup` function allows for executing a flow within your app and retrieves the
resulting payload, taking the flow's name and an input payload as parameters.

The specified flow is executed using the current attributes, variables, and
error. It only replaces the payload for the first parameter, which must be a Java
type.

Learn more about `lookup` link:dataweave-lookup[here].

=== Matching Errors by Types (`causedBy` Function)

The `causedBy` function matches an error by its type, like an error handler
does. This is useful when matching by a super type is required but specific sub-type
logic also needed or when handling a `COMPOSITE_ROUTING` error that contains child
errors of different types.

The error to match against can be implicit, but the type is always a required parameter.

In the following example, a global error handler is set up to handle `SECURITY`
errors in a general way, while specific actions are set up for `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED`
and `HTTP:FORBIDDEN` errors.

.Example: Error Matcher Function Usage
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<error-handler name="securityHandler">
  <on-error-continue type="SECURITY">
    <!-- general error handling for all SECURITY errors -->
    <choice>
      <when expression="#[error causedBy 'HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED']">
        <!-- specific error handling only for HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED errors -->
      </when>
      <when expression="#[causedBy('HTTP:FORBIDDEN')]">
        <!-- specific error handling only for HTTP:FORBIDDEN errors -->
      </when>
    </choice>
  </on-error-continue>
</error-handler>
----

Notice that the error parameter is used both explicitly and implicitly.

== Connector and Component Functions

When using connectors and components in a Mule app, you can inject functions. Unlike the Runtime functions, these functions require a namespace, which usually matches the component name.

For example, in an app using Batch you can use the following expression: `#[Batch::isSuccessfulRecord()]`.
