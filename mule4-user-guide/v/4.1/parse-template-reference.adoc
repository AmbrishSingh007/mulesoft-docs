//TODO: NEED TO UPDATE THIS 3.9 VERSION TO 4.1.

The *Parse Template* is a Mule component that allows you to process a template, obtaining a result. A template is defined as a text with embedded Mule expressions that are evaluated and replaced with their result.

The template can be configured via an external file reference or  it can be embedded in the component definition itself.

*<<Complete Code Example>>*

== Configuring a Parse Template


Drag a *parse template* message processor from the palette onto the canvas, then configure the fields according to the table below.

[%header,cols="20a,20a,60a"]
|===
|Field |Value |Description
|*Content* |Template String |A string to use as template. If wanted, instead of having the template defined in an external file, it can be written inline using this field. It can have embedded expressions to be evaluated and replaced for their results.
|*Display Name* |Parse Template |Customize to display a unique name for the transformer in your application.
|*Location* |filepath |Define the location of the file that Mule uses as a template into which to insert values extracted from the message properties or variables.
|*Target Variable* | Variable Name | The name of a variable where to store the result of evaluating the expression defined in Target Value.
|*Target Value* | Expression | Mule Expression to be evaluated after executing the parse template and which result is stored in a variable with name as defined in the Target Variable field.

In the XML Editor or Standalone, do this

Add a `parse-template` element to your flow, then configure according to the tables below.

[source, xml]
----
<parse-template location="users/administrator/desktop/hrweb/confirmation.html" doc:name="Parse Template"/>
----

Attributes of the `parse-template` element:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Element Attributes |Value
|`content`     |A string representing the template to be used where the embedded expressions will be evaluated and replaced by their results.
|`location`    |Filepath which defines the location of the file that Mule uses as a template into which to insert values extracted from the message properties or variables.
|`doc:name`    |Customize to display a unique name for the transformer in your application. (Note: Not needed in Mule standalone.)
|`target`      |The name of a variable where the result of the expression defined in `targetValue` will be stored after the parse template is executed.
|`targetValue` |A Mule Expression that will be evaluated after the parse template is executed and which result will be stored in a variable with name as defined in the `target` attribute.

== Complete Code Example

The following example demonstrates the use of a parse template in an application which accepts queries by employeeID in order to acquire data about an employee.  

In this case, the Parse Template uses a flow-external file as a template into which it inserts values for fields – name, department, job title, start date, and employee type – drawn from the message payload. The flow then returns the template-built payload to the caller.

To use the application in this example, you must send an HTTP request with a URL that includes an ID query parameter, such as http://localhost:8081/getEmployee?id=12345.
