= To Create a Server (EU Control Plane)

- Same procedures as AP in the US.
- The following consideration.

- The amc_setup command you use must include the --region eu1 flag. For example:
	- ./amc_setup --region eu1 -H 1234321sxxxxx----16 server-name

- This flag ensures that the server connects to Runtime Manager in the EU Control Plane.
