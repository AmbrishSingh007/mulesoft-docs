= About the EU Control Plane

MuleSoft hosts a version of the Anypoint Platform control plane entirely within the EU. The EU control plane is a version of MuleSoftâ€™s fully hosted, fully managed control plane running in the AWS Frankfurt data center. This enables you to deploy and manage your APIs, applications, and related data entirely within the European Union. This includes data and metadata about your MuleSoft implementation. The EU Control Plane ensures that all MuleSoft data is maintained within the EU.

In addition to the EU Control Plane, deployment targets for MuleSoft managed runtimes are also mainainted in EU data center. Having both the control and runtime planes entirely within the boundaries enables you to more effectively meet emerging regulatory requirements.
