= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange lists MuleSoft and organization assets, which lets you reuse and collaborate within your organization. Assets can be examples, templates, REST or OAS APIs, connectors, and custom items. Exchange helps you create portals, view and test APIs, add mocking services to APIs, create assets, and create API Notebooks that let you describe and test API functions. 

With Exchange and Anypoint Studio, you can add connectors, templates, and examples directly into Studio so you can try new ideas, connect to new resources, and work from proven starting points. 

Exchange assets are also accessible from API Manager and Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform, and you can publish APIs
from Design Center to Exchange.

Exchange provides three views:

* Exchange public - Find hundreds of reusable connectors and templates provided by MuleSoft and its partners.

* Exchange private - Find assets within your organization.

* Exchange portal - Find API assets using a public facing portal that has been customized with your logo and brand imagery.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
