= To Save Searches

As an Exchange administrator, you can save searches that your
users can click to access assets within a business group.

The saved searches appear in the left navigation bar of the 
Assets page under the Organization Searches heading.

While users can view and click the searches, only an 
Exchange administrator can save, rename, or delete the searches.

. Change to the business group where you want to add saved searches.
. Specify a search in the search field.
. Click Save This Search.
. In the Save Search window, specify the name for the search, and save the search name. The saved search appears in the left navigation area.
. If needed, click the settings button for the search to the right of 
the search name in the left navigation area.
. To rename the search, select the text in the navigation bar field and
provide a new name followed by pressing the Enter or Return key on your keyboard. 
. To delete the search, click Delete from the search name Setting menu.
