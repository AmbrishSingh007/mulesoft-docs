= To Change a RAML Version
:imagesdir: ./_images

You can change a RAML version either in the RAML specification itself or when you publish to Anypoint Exchange.

From the RAML specification:

Change the `version:` element in your RAML specification.
You can use a text editor or API Designer in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.
When you update the version element in the RAML specification and publish to Exchange, the publish
menu automatically picks up the change from the `version:` element.

When you publish to Exchange:

. From Design Center, open your API. No changes are necessary. 
. Click the Publish to Exchange button (image:ex-publish-to-exchange-button.png[]).
