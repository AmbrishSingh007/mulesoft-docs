= To Create Categories
:imagesdir: ./_images

Exchange Administrators and Organization Owners can create categories to 
enable organizations to group access to Exchange types. 

For example, a category called Department can have a Marketing sub-category, and
the Marketing category would have access only to Connectors, Templates, and Examples.

To create a category:

. In Anypoint Exchange, click Login and log into your organization.
. Click Settings in the left navigation area.
. Click Add New Category.
. Specify a category name. Each category name must be unique.
. Specify a value. Each category must have a value.
. Click the plus sign next to the value to enable the value:

+
Note: If the plus sign is not clicked, the check mark to indicate the category has no 
effect.
+
. Choose the access types that the category corresponds to.
+
Important: Choose the access types wisely. After you apply the category 
to one or more assets, the category access types cannot be changed or the category deleted without going back to every asset you apply the category to and deleting the category from the asset.
+
. Click the checkmark to enable the category.
. Click an asset in your organization. 
. In Categories in the right details menu, click Add Category and choose the category from the drop-down menu. The Category automatically saves itself in the asset.

== Changing or Deleting a Category

After you apply a category to an asset, to change or delete a category from the 
Settings menu, you need to open every asset you applied the category to and delete the category from the asset. 

After deleting the category you want to change or delete from all assets that you applied the category to, you can return to the Settings menu and change or delete the category.
