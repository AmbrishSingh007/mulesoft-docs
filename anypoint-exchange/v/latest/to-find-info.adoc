= To Find Asset Information
:imagesdir: ./_images

When you click an asset, the right detail panel lists the asset type, when the asset was created and by which organization, when the asset was last published, the version, and the asset's dependencies. 

In a REST API, you can click a method such as GET or POST, and the right detail panel lets you send requests to the API and view the responses. Additional pages appear in the left navigation bar.

== Exchange Search

Search lets you find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms 
in an asset title, asset ID, or a tag in an asset. Assets
that were migrated from Exchange 1 also include the description text
in searches.

Exchange search uses these guidelines:

* Searching by Phrases - When searching for an asset, Exchange 
does not interpret regular expression keywords but instead 
searches for the term you specify. You can put a space between words to search for case-insensitive text that begins with each word you specify. This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word. Also,
if you separate words with symbols or put search terms in quotes, it's the same as an AND search where all words must appear in the asset consecutively.

* Scope - Searches only apply to the Exchange you are viewing. 
If you search in a private Exchange, the search only lists the
private Exchange assets and not public Exchange assets.

== To Save Search

. Enter a search term and click Save This Search.
. Exchange prompts you to give the search a name, and to select if the search is for your organization or personal. Administrators can save searches visible to anyone in their current business group. Personal searches are visible only to the person who creates them.

== To Search for Phrases

You can put a space between words to search for 
case insensitive text that begins with each word you specify. 
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.
For example searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that 
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Each word in a multiple word phrase need to be present in an asset 
for the search to succeed.

If you separate search words with any other character than a space, Exchange 
converts the character to a space before searching.

=== About Search Separators

Search lets you find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms in an asset name, asset ID, or a tag.  

If you input search words connected by non-alphanumeric symbols, Exchange replaces the symbols with spaces before searching for the term. The search string only succeeds if both words are present in the result. This is the same as the `word1 AND word2` relationship.

Exchange searches asset names, asset ID values, and tag values. Assets migrated from Exchange 1 also allow the search to include text in an asset's description.

Examples:

[source,example,linenums]
----
sales:connect
Sales-Connect
connect:/sales
-connect -sales
----

The following is a list of assets that may or may not match one of the previous searches:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |Yes
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |Yes
|Validations API |validations-api |salesforce-connecting |Yes
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, salesforce:enabled |Yes
|Cisco Sales API  |cisco-sales-api |Connecting, Productive |Yes
|Cisco Connector |cisco-connector |com.cisco.connector.sales
|Yes, because the tag is split into separate terms.
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |muleconnector, MuleConnector |No. `connect` was not found. 
|Salesforce Connec |salesforce-connec |REST |No. `connect` was not found.
|Validations API |validations-api |connector |No. `sales` was not found.
|Cisco Presales API |cisco-presales-api |Connector, api |No. `sales` was not found.

== About Phrase Search

Exchange search features phrase search, which allows you to query for a group of terms inside quotation marks. Phrase searches match an asset only if all the exact terms inside quotes appear in consecutive order.

If you input any of the following searches in Exchange, Exchange replaces  non-alphanumeric symbols to spaces before searching for assets.

[source,example,linenums]
----
Api: "Sales connect"	
Api "Sales-connect"	
Api "Sales:/connect"	
Api-"Sales/connect"	
"Sales connect":Api
----
	
Exchange searches asset names, asset ID values, and tag values. Assets migrated from Exchange 1 also allow the search to include text in an asset's description.

The following is a list of assets that may or may not match one of the previous searches:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |No
|Sales Connect Asset |validations-api |mule-connector |Yes
|Sales Connect Images |validations-images |mule-connector |No. `api` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, sales:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/sales, connect:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found, because each term is in different tags.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |sales:/connect |Yes

== To View REST API Elements in an Asset

. In the left navigation area you can view RAML or OAS API specification information such as resources and the methods in each resource. Click a method button to view information about the API:
+
image:ex2-rest-ftns.png[Screenshot - REST API function buttons in left nav bar]
+
. Use the right side of a method view to experiment with the API. This functionality is similar to what you can expect in programs such as Postman where you can specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. Click Request Access to tie the API you're viewing to one of your applications so that you can use the API to send and receive data that your application can consume.

=== To Test an API with API Notebook

. Click API Notebook in the content page if one is available for the API.
. After you read the description for usage information, you can experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values, and see the results in real time.
. Click Play to test the method in the code example and view the results.

== To View Assets by Business Group

Anypoint Platform provides the option for business groups that organize content into categories. 

In Anypoint Exchange, different assets may appear in each business group. Each organization 
chooses which assets are in each business group.

If you cannot find 
an asset in one group, it may be in another business group. If you cannot view a business group, contact your site's administrator.

To change business groups, click a group name from the taskbar.
