= Auto-Upgrade Notice for the November Release of Anypoint Platform

The November release includes many improvements across API Designer, API Portal, and API Manager.

MuleSoft will automatically upgrade customers with 20 or fewer APIs unless your platform administrator opts out (<<opt _out>>). A self-service upgrade process will be available for customers with over 20 APIs.

The upgrade schedule depends on the number of APIs in your organization:

* January 29-31: Customers with fewer than 5 APIs will be _automatically_ upgraded to the new experience.
* February 14-16: Customers with fewer than 20 APIs will be upgraded.
* Starting February 19th: Customers with more than 20 APIs will be offered self-service experience to migrate.

== What’s in the release?

* New experience: ADD_PUBLIC_LINK (TODO: need public link to this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16MXR2CPjuw_DZGkKPAsKh1194QFcBMd7/view)
* New capabilities: https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/new-product-features
 ** Changes and features: link:anypoint-november-release[Anypoint Platform July and November Release: Release Notes]

Because many of the new products have new features and a different UX, please consider the following:

* For API Portal, the look and feel is changing. This change is especially important for public API portals that are exposed to external developers.
* The API lifecycle is slightly different, so if you are in the middle of a big release, be sure to communicate this to your team(s).
* Other Anypoint accounts that might be used by you or other developers in your organization might retain the same, “old” Anypoint Platform experience.

== After the upgrade

All your APIs in API Manager will be in the unclassified environment.

To access your APIs:

. Go to API Manager.
. Select the unclassified environment.
+
From the unclassified environment, you can manage your APIs in the same way that you did before the November release.
+
. When you are ready for the new environment capabilities of the November release, classify your APIs into environments, or create new APIs in them.
