== Migration Guide

== Migration Guide

Studio 7.1 only supports Mule 4.x projects. The structure of the project, export format, xml and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See the Mule migration guide for more information.

== JIRA Ticket List for Anypoint Studio

=== Known Issues

* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7.1: Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the link:/anypoint-studio/v/7/faq-default-browser-config[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.

* When adding a Raml v0.8 from exchange as a dependency, it throws an error and it's not added it. STUDIO-10247
* Copybook import fails with no message. STUDIO-10206
* Copybook import file not copied to project. STUDIO-10207
* Menu items get grayed out after opening Exchange using XulRunner. STUDIO-9684

* Running application "Pom.xml" is not updated when changing dependencies. STUDIO-9148
* Debugger: payload shown while debugging is partial but there is no way to view the rest of the payload STUDIO-9704
* When referencing a RAML spec using Json Schema draft 3, DataSense fails STUDIO-10033

==== KNWON ISSUES SOAP API

* WSDL from URL does not work, you must copy the file in src\main\resources\api even if the UI suggest to use a URL.
* Sometimes scaffolding of flows in Windows does not work (right click on a WSDL in src\main\resources\api  - Mule > Generate Flows from WSDL - No exception logged).
* Metadata Keys in Windows do not work, the Service and Port combo boxes are never populated with the values.
* In OS X, after configuring a WSDL you have to manually do click in Refresh icon in order to get the Service and Port combo boxes populated and you have to do it once for Service and once for Port.
* In OS X there is a NPE in metadata propagation after manually configure the global SoapKit router values and going to the SopaKit router in the canvas.
* In Windows there is a different NPE after configuring the WSDL location and clicking OK in the Global Config.
* When searching for a WSDL file that is not in the api folder there is no warning and it doensâ€™t work.
