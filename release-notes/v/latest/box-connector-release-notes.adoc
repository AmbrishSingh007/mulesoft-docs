=== Version 4.0.0 - Fixed in this Release

=== Version 3.1.2 - Features

None.

=== Version 3.1.2 - Fixed in this Release

* *Failure to test the connection in OAuth Server to Sever configuration* - Similar to the issue fixed in Box 3.1.1 but in the context of a mavenized Mule application. The issue was caused by the Bouncy Castle dependencies shaded in version 3.0.0.

=== Version 3.1.2 - Known Issues

None.

== Version 3.1.1 - June 2, 2017

=== Version 3.1.1 - Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]

=== Version 3.1.1 - Features

None.

=== Version 3.1.1 - Fixed in this Release

* *Failure to test the connection in OAuth Server to Sever configuration* - In the previous version, the Test Connection would throw the exception `NoSuchAlgorithmException: PBKDF-OpenSSL SecretKeyFactory not available`. This was caused by a conflict in the version of the BouncyCastle library used by the connector (1.52) and the one shipped with the Mule Runtime (i.e Mule 3.8.0 bundles 1.54). In the current version, the Test Connection works as expected.

== Version 3.1.0 - March 8, 2017

=== Version 3.1.0 - Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|Software |Version

=== Version 3.1.0 - Features

* The following operations now support pagination:
** Folders
*** Get Folder's Items
*** Get Trashed Items
*** Get Folder Collaborations
** Groups
*** Get Groups for an Enterprise
*** Get Memberships for Group
*** Get User's Memberships.
** Users
*** Get Enterprise Users
* Improvement of exception messages: in addition to the HTTP status code, error messages also return the complete description of the failure cause.
* Fields are now validated before sending the request: previously only a HTTP 400 response was returned.
* New operation `Search with Parameters`: unlike the search provided by the Box SDK, which still remains as an operation but deprecated, it provides all the parameters supported by the API, except for `mdfilters` and `filters`.

=== Version 3.1.0 - Fixed in this Release

* Shaded a bouncycastle dependency: This was done to fix an issue produced on Mule EE 3.8.0.
