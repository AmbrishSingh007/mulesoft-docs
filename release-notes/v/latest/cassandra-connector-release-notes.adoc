== Version 3.0.0 - January 12, 2018

Cassandra connector is available in Mule 4.0.

=== Version 3.0.0 - Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|Application/Service |Version
|Cassandra database or cluster | 1.2 and later
|CQL spec | 3.x
|Mule Runtime | 4.0 and later

== Version 2.0.0 - Compatibility

The Cassandra connector was implemented using the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra 3.1. The connector is compatible with the following software:

* Cassandra database or cluster 1.2 or later
* Cassandra 3.0.11 or earlier if you use the Change Column Type operation
* CQL spec 3.x
* Anypoint Studio 6.x and Mule Runtime 3.6 or later, or Mule Runtime only

The capability to change the data type of a column using the CQL alter table query was removed from Cassandra 3.0.11 and later; consequently, the Cassandra connector Change Column Type operation does not work if you connect to a Cassandra database that does not support this capability.


=== Version 2.0.0 - Key Features

The Cassandra connector supports the following capabilities:

* Basic Authentication for accessing the database as configured in the cassandra.yaml
* Executing any CQL query using a custom POJO
* Performing the following Cassandra Query Language (CQL) database operations, which are described in the Cassandra Connector javadoc, using a wizard:
