=== Version 1.0.2 - Features
* No new features added

=== Version 1.0.2 - Fixed in this Release

* Dynamics 365 Connector was throwing a TimeOutException after receiving a 204 response from the API for an update operation. This was happening because the HTTP client we are using has some memory leaks and we had to override the default implementation.
* Dynamics 365 Connector was throwing a TimeOutException after 30 seconds even if the configured timeout value was greater. Now the exception is thrown after the configured timeout value.
* Dynamics 365 Connector was creating a new connection for each request, not using the maximum number of connections configured in the pool. Another issue here was that the connections were never released. Now the issues are fixed.
*  Dynamic 365 connector does not refresh OAuth token after expiration
*  Creating entity with a GUID using Dynamics 365 Connector throws metadata error
*  Dynamic365 connector does not support Edm.Date
*  Dynamics 365 connector edm.datetimeoffset issue
*  Null values not accepted for Int32 fields
*  Error when converting decimal fields
*  Unauthorized [HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized] error raised when token expired
