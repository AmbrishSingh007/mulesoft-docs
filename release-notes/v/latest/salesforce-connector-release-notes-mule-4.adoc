=== Version 9.1.1 - Features

    * Added the isForceResubscribe method in Salesforce Bayeux Client.
    * Support Anypoint Studio Proxy configuration as default.

=== Version 9.1.1 - Fixed in this Release

    * Trigger operation was not retrieving MetadataKeysId. Solved by adding support for retrieving metadata in case of sources.
    * Reply topic was losing messages in case the connection has been lost for less than 40 seconds; this is the amount of time that is needed to trigger re-subscribe naturally according to Salesforce documentation. The issue was solved by forcing re-subscription whenever the network connection is lost.
    * *Buffering capacity exceeded* triggered when connector consumed from a topic more than 10000 messages. The issue was solved by adding a new attribute for the *Replay streaming channel* operation: Buffer Size In Bytes, it's an optional parameter with the default value of 26MB.
    * Wrong transformation of fields of type Date. Trying to update or insert an Object in Salesforce with fields of type Date caused a failure, this was due to failure in serializing the objects of type Date. The issue was solved by parsing the values received from the Mule flow and converting them into the expected Salesforce accepted format.
