= Introduction to Mule 4: Studio 7

Before diving into what's new in Mule 4, you should install and familiarize yourself with Studio 7. It is the development environment for Mule 4 applications. Beyond support for Mule 4, it includes many new productivity improvements. Note that Studio 7 does not support opening Mule 3 applications.

== New Mule Palette
When using the Studio 6 palette, finding the right operation was a multi-step process: you had to find the connector, drag it onto the canvas, then search for an operation. To speed up this process, there is a new two-level palette that improves access times, discoverability, and categorization. You can search directly for a connector operation and easily add commonly used operations to your “favorites.”

Managing your connectors and modules has also improved. In Studio 7, you can explicitly add versions of connectors to your project––making the palette specific to your project. As a result, you no longer have to see connectors or modules you aren’t using.

== Managing Dependencies, Automatic Maven integration

In previous versions of Studio, every Module used to be an Eclipse plugin that needed to be installed through an “update site” mechanism. Now, every Module is simply a project dependency, managed by Maven underneath the covers. This means that you no longer have to deal with huge “update sites,” plugin installations, or plugin versions. Studio will automatically add Maven dependencies to the ‘pom.xml’ file and keep track of them for you.

If you don't know Maven, don't worry, Studio will manage Maven for you automatically by reating a default ‘‘pom.xml’ file for every project.

== Navigating to XML View

Users can now quickly navigate to the XML from the visual view. Simply right click on any component and select ‘Go to XML.’

== Anypoint Platform Account Management
We’ve improved how you manage your Anypoint Platform accounts as well, making it easier to publish and consume different assets from within Studio and see which business group you are working with. We enabled this by creating a universal user toolbar that appears in every operation related to the Platform. This toolbar enables you to switch between users and organizations, or even add accounts.

== Metadata Storage
Mule 4 applications now contain an ‘application-types.xml’ file, which is where metadata around your data types is stored. For example, if you create a new CSV type, that metadata will be added to this file. This new file is easy to share, commit, and merge when conflicts arise–enabling users to do more metadata-driven development.

== Other Improvements

* A new set of graphic icons for better usability.
* A watermark text  that will always display the “Operation Name” when a user changes the default “Display Name” of the operation, providing better visibility.
* Collapsible flows with interactive preview.
