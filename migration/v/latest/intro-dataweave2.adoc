= Mule 4 for Mule 3 Users: DataWeave Language Changes

DataWeave 2 is largely unchanged from DataWeave 1, however we have made many improvements to make it easier to learn and add new capabilities.

== Operators Are Functions
In DataWeave 2, all operators are now functions. While this can involve more parentheses, it is less ambiguous and more friendly for new users learning via auto-completion. The previous syntax continues to work for functions with two parameters, providing a shorter syntax for power users.
|DataWeave 1|sizeOf payload filter $.age > 30 |
|DataWeave 2 - Function Syntax|sizeOf(filter(payload, (value) -> value.age > 30)))|
|DataWeave 2 - Shortcut Syntax|sizeOf(payload filter $.age > 30)|

== Traits Are Functions
|DataWeave 1|paylaod is :empty|
|DataWeave 2|isEmpty(payload)|

== Type Names
DataWeave 2 uses a more user-friendly type name syntax, which removes the `:` from the name.
|DataWeave 1|payload.foo as :string|
|DataWeave 2|payload.foo as String|

== New capabilities
There are also many new capabilities, including:
 * Typing for reusable functions
 * Multiline comments
 * Ability to call out to Java code
 * Multipart, URL encoded, and text readers and writers
 * Modules and imports
 * and more
