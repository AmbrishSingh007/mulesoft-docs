= Introduction to Mule 4: Error Handlers

TODO: background to REVISE...
In order to move away from the Java/OOP centric approach of “exception strategies” we will instead define an “error handler” for each flow, which in turn will allow several “on error” components capable of handling certain error types. Thus the concept of exceptions and catching them will be hidden from users, moving to “errors” that everyone understands.
The thrown exception will still be available for more advanced users and users familiar with 3.x, but an error type will be assigned as well and be the main filtering element.

TODO: FROM BLOG, PARAPHRASED...
In Mule 4, error handling is no longer limited to a Java exception handling process that required you to check the source code or force the error to understand what happened. Though Java `Throwable` errors and exceptions are still available, the Mule 4 error-handling semantic, which is based on the Mule Runtime engine’s own errors, includes component-specific errors that provide more useful error data and are routable to an error handler.

Helpful for migration guide info:

One issue we’ve also addressed in Mule 4 is the need for more fine-grained error handling. For the most part, Mule 3 only allows handling errors at the flow level, forcing you to extract logic to a flow in order to address errors.

In Mule 4, we’ve introduced a try scope that you can use within a flow to do error handling of just inner components. The scope also supports transactions––replacing the old transactional scope.

Ana (for Monday, not this weekend), is there anything we should say about migrating these?
* Custom Exception Strategy
* Exception
* Mapping Exception Strateg

custom exception strategy -> no longer supported, they can always have an error handler with an on error that internally uses the java module for any logic they desire, exception-> don’t know what you mean, can you give me an example?, mapping-exception-strategy -> this is apikit specific, they have migrated their exception handler and it’s now a regular one, you can check that out for reference

NOTES:
Ana sent this on error handling which features a migration
section at the bottom: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b4D3m3Tqkz1_EjSHmn68w7Lxv43N6Wzb92LkeqHPyyE/edit I asked her to look at new multipart section in my DW working branch:
