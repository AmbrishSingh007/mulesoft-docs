= Introduction to Mule 4: the Mule Message

Mule 4 includes a simplified Mule Message model. In this simplified model, Mule Events have a Message and variables associated with it. A Message is composed of a payload and its attributes (metadata, such as files size). Variables hold arbitrary information such as Messages, payload data, or attributes. This simplified message model makes it easier to work with data in a consistent way across connectors without information being overwritten.

== Inbound Properties are now attributes

In Mule 3, inbound properties were used to store additional information about a payload obtained through a Message Source, such as the query parameters coming through an http listener. Attributes are the successor to these, and have two advantages: 

1) they are strongly typed, so you can easily see what data is available and 
2) they can easily be stored in a variables for access throughout your flow. Here's an example of a typical Mule Message in Mule 4, which is from an HTTP Listener:

Attributes can be easily accessed via expressions, just as inbound properties were, for example:
[source,linenums]
----
attributes.requestPath
attributes.queryParams.searchCriteria
----

== Outbound Properties

In Mule 3, connectors and transports which need to send additional data such as headers, need to explicitly specify Outbound properties. For example, with the HTTP listener, you may want to specify the outgoing status code response or headers. In Mule 4, you can set each of those concept separately using individual DataWeave expression for each one of them, without introducing any side effects in the main flow:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request path="issues" config-ref="http" method="GET">
    <http:headers>#[{'path':'input/issues-list.json'}]</http:headers>
    <http:query-params>#[{'provider':'memory-provider'}]</http:query-params>
</http:request>
----

In the example above, we see how to do an HTTP request in which we uso individual DataWeave scripts to generate headers and query parameters, without the need to set message properties nor generating any side effects on the message.

The same concept can be applied for message sources which emits responses, such an http listener:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener config-ref="api-httpListenerConfig" path="/api/*" doc:name="Listener">
    <http:response statusCode="#[vars.httpStatus default 200]">
        <http:headers>#[vars.outboundHeaders default {}]</http:headers>
    </http:response>
    <http:error-response statusCode="#[vars.httpStatus default 500]">
        <http:body>#[payload]</http:body>
        <http:headers>#[vars.outboundHeaders default {}]</http:headers>
    </http:error-response>
</http:listener>
----

== Session Properties
Because transport barriers don't exist anymore, Session properties are no longer needed and have been removed in Mule 4. Users should store data in variables.

== Message Collections
One of the benefits of the new Mule Message structure is when dealing with collections. In Mule 3, components
that returned multiple payloads, used a special structure called the `MuleMessageCollection`. In Mule 4, any component
that needs to deal with multiple messages can simple set the payload of the message to a List of Mule Messages. You can
then iterate over these messages using DataWeave, For Each, or other components.

For example, when using the `<file:list>` operation, it retrieves a list of Messages. Each Message has Attributes for
each file, making it easy to make decisions based on file size, whether it's a directory, etc.
