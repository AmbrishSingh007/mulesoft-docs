= Introduction to Mule 4: Connectors

In Mule 3, there were two ways of connecting to systems: transports and connectors. Transports used
the concept of inbound and outbound endpoints to send data. Connectors used the concept of operations to invoke
systems, for example, `<http:request>` or `<db:select>`. In Mule 3, MuleSoft started to replace some of these
transports through the new HTTP and Database connectors. Mule 4 completes this change by
completely standardizing the approach so that all connectivity is built as connectors. This has
improved the consistency and usability of connectors, as well as enabled more powerful connectors.
