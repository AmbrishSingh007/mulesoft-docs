= Migration to Mule 4

Mule 4 introduces many improvements over Mule 3 that make it easier to learn,
develop, and manage. For an overview of these capabilities, you should read
link:/mule-user-guide/4.0/mule-runtime-updates[What's New in Mule 4] for a high-level introduction to the new features.

You can use this documentation for guidance on migrating applications manually or simply to learn about the differences between Mule 3 and Mule 4. It includes information on these topics:

* link:intro-overview[Introduction to Mule 4]: An overview of Mule 4 for those who already know Mule 3.
* link:migration-prep[Preparing for the Migration]: Steps to think about before migrating a Mule app.
* link:migration-process[About the Migration Process]: An overview of the major steps involved in a migration.
* link:migration-examples[Migration Examples]: End-to-end examples that show the before (Mule 3) and after (Mule 4) syntax.
* More in-depth migration details:
 ** link:migration-patterns[Migration Patterns]
 ** link:migration-core[Migrating Core Components]
 ** link:migration-patterns[Migration Patterns]
 ** link:migration-connectors[Migrating Connectors]
 ** link:migration-api-gateways[Migrating API Gateways]
 ** link:migration-mel[Migrating from MEL to DataWeave]
 ** link:migration-dataweave[Migrating from DataWeave 1.0 to 2.x]
 ** link:migration-munit[Migrating MUnit]
 ** link:migration-devkit-to-mule-sdk[Migrating DevKit to the Mule SDK]

IMPORTANT: MuleSoft will be releasing a tool to help automatically update applications to Mule 4 soon. Unless there is some urgent need to migrate now, we recommend that you save time on the migration by waiting to migrate until this tool is available.

This guide should apply to all 3.x versions. However, the 3.x examples reference Mule 3.9.
