= Preparing for the Migration

Topics for this section:

* PLANNING: what does a manager need to think about before migrating.
* Understand what’s automated
  - Per Mariano G:  Migrator probably won't be ready at Mule 4 GA, perhaps not until Q2(?), so users who want to get started early will need to manually migrate everything.
* Understand what’s manual.
* Any specific resources they’ll need to get started
* Anything else they need to think about prior to migrating?
