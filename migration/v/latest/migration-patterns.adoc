// Contacts/SMEs: Mariano Gonzales,
= Migration Patterns

(*NOTE: We can break the topics out into separate files if necessary*)

Topics for this section:

* link::migration-patterns-transformers[Migrating Transformers to the Transform Component]
* TODO (PLG): link::migration-patterns-calling-java[Calling Java functions]
* TODO (sduke): <<target_vs_enricher>>: Short description here. Enrichment.
* TODO: <<attributes_vs_inbound_props>>: Short description here.
* Using message properties and attributes
* TODO: Message builders vs outbound properties: Short description here.
* TODO? Embedding DW inside operations
* TODO? New Error Handling
* New Watermark: MG says there's a new boolean in some core connectors to enable the watermark. Watermark is new to Cloud connectors though (talk to MNC). Core connectors are FTP/SFTP, VM, File by Mule 4 GA, and DB soon after that.
** Cover this, too? Some Mule4 compliant connectors (which lack watermark switch) might support watermark as described in old Object Store spec.
* Remove transformers
* Transports vs. connectors
