= Expiration Policies

In Mule 4, you can set up an expiration policy (`<expiration-policy/>`) for idle configuration instances. Note that this element is a sibling of the database-specific configuration (such as `<db:oracle-connection />`) and is not nested under it.

.Mule 4 Example
[source,xml, linenums]
----
<expiration-policy maxIdleTime="30" timeUnit="SECONDS"/>
