== Archive Process

At a high level, the documentation process follows this pattern:

. Add files to the archive branch:
+
* Copy files to be archived from the master branch to the archive branch.
* Fix links of the copied files in the archive branch.
* Update the TOCs (top level and product or product version level).
* Update the top-level landing page (index.adoc) to include a link to the archived docs.
* Add ARCHIVE labels to the landing page for the newly archived docs.
+
. Build to _site and test the docs locally.
+
* Build: $ ./gradlew
* Test by running a link checker and making sure that the TOCs, Archive labels, and landing pages are ok.
+
. Provide a copy of the _site content to IT for posting on Amazon S3 bucket.
. Remove files from master.
. Fix any broken links in master.
. Test links.
