This is the repository for archived versions of MuleSoft's documentation and contains the source content for the archive doc site [TBD]. In general these docs are for products or product versions that have reached their end of life (EOL) and are no longer supported by MuleSoft. Its content will only change as new docs are archived. Otherwise, it will not undergo any updates or corrections.

== Archive Process

. Add files to the archive branch:
+
* Copy files to be archived from the master branch to the archive branch.
* Fix links of the copied files in the archive branch.
* Update the TOCs (top level and product or product version level).
* Update the top-level landing page (index.adoc) to include a link to the archived docs.
* Add ARCHIVE labels to the landing page for the newly archived docs.
+
. Build to `_site` and test the docs locally.
+
* Build: `$ ./gradlew`
* Test by running a link checker (such as blc) and making sure that the TOCs, Archive labels, and landing pages are ok.
+
. Make sure that IT gets a copy of the final `_site/` content so they can publish it on the Amazon S3 bucket that serves the Archive Doc Site. (Note that IT can build this content themselves once it's ready for publication.)
. Remove archived files from `master`.
. Fix any broken links in `master`.
. Test links in master.

== Tools and Tips

* Link Checker: A good link checker is Broken Link Checker (`blc`). You can download it and run a command like this on a local doc build:
$ blc -roe http://127.0.0.1/ > ../link_check
+
The `link_check` file clearly identifies links that are BROKEN in each file on the local site.
+
* One easy way to get files from the `master` to the `archive` branch:
+
. Check out the `master` branch: `$ git checkout master`
. Copy the directory that contains the files you want to archive: $ cp -r /4.1 /4.1.archive`
. Check out the `archive` branch: `$ git checkout archive`
. Rename the folders back to their original name.
. Add the contents of the folders to the `archive` branch: `git add /path/to/4.1/*`
. Commit an push the new files in.
