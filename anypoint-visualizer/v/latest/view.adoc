== Anypoint Visualizer topology
The topology of the application network is automatically generated by Anypoint Visualizer. To maximize visualization readivility, "consumer"
 nodes (i.e. nodes that only have outbound connections), are shown at the top, and all "backend systems" (i.e. nodes with inbound connections only) are shown at the bottom. All consumer nodes are grouped by ClientId when possible, and otherwise grouped under the "External Traffic" node.
