= How Anypoint Visualizer Collects Application Data

Anypoint Visualizer collects runtime information from running applications, APIs, and proxies to detect all of its dependencies. The following is a sample of the type of information that's being collected and sent to the control plane, where it is stored encrypted in a database.

----
[{
    "node_info": { <information about the node>
        "org_id": < customer org id>,
        "env_id": <customer env id>,
    "ip": <host ips>,
    "type": "MULE",
    “deployment_id”:<a unique id for every new deployment ex: hash of the mule application that this node is running>, 
“X_APP_ID”:<a unique identifier for the application>,
“app_name”:
"url": <optional public fullDomain  Ex: foo.cloudhub.io>
},
“events” : [{
“source”: {
        <in case of an outbound connection,node_info>
        <In case of an inbound connection, info about the caller from message> 
        "protocol": "http",
            "ip": "<source ip from X_forwared_for_header ex:34.235.222.42>",
            “client_id”:”<cliend_id if available>”,
            "type": "HTTP",
“X_APP_ID”:<a unique identifier for the client application>
}
“destination”:{
<in case of an inbound connection, node_info>
<in case of an outbound connection, destination url from the message>
"protocol": "HTTP",
            "port": "80",
            "type": "HTTP",
            “X_APP_ID”:<a unique identifier for the server application>,    
            "url": "<destination url. Ex: visualizer-test-app.cloudhub.io>”
 }
“properties”: {<any additional property about this connection ex. count>}

}]
}]

== Disable Data Collection for an Application

Specific applications can be excluded from the visualizer by disabling the it's collection of runtime data by configuring the property *anypoint.platform.config.visualizer.agent.enabled=true/false*
