= Roles

This topic describes how to use Access Management to use roles to manage permissions within Anypoint Platform. This topic assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization or that you have API Versions Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for an API version.

A role is a set of pre-defined permissions for each product component within Anypoint Platform. Depending on the product, you can use pre-defined roles with standard permissions, or you can specify your own permissions for each role. You can assign individuals to a role, or you can assign a role to another role.

Anypoint Platform provides two types of roles:

* *Default roles*: roles that are created automatically when an organization or business group is created. These roles provide permissions and access to core functionality of Anypoint Platform. You can modify default roles by assigning users or other roles. However, you cannot delete a default role.

* *Custom roles*: roles that a user can create, customize, and delete. You can assign users or roles to a custom role. You can also associate a custom role to a specific application. For example, you can create a custom role called Application Designer and assign that role to the Design Center application.

== The Organization Owner

The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the *Organization Owner*. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

When the Organization Owner creates a business-group, it must assign a user as the owner of it. This user holds an Administrator role within that business group by default.

== Default Roles

=== To Edit a Default Role

You can edit a role by changing its name, description, or by adding users to the role.

. Login to Access Management, then click Roles.
. Click the name of the default role you want to edit.
+
Default roles do not have a radial button next to them.
. To add a user to the role, enter their name in the search box.

=== List of Default Roles

The following table lists the default roles that are automatically created as part of an organization:

[%header,cols="30,80"]
|===
| Role Name | Description
|API Creators | Enables a user to create and manage API versions in the Anypoint Platform for APIs. Members of the API Creator role have the ability to add new APIs to the platform on the API administration page. This role does not grant privileges for Runtime Manager.
|Portals Viewer | Enable a user to view a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. The ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API. You cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.
|API Versions Owner | Enables a user to manage, delete, and deprecate any API in the organization. They can edit the portal of any API in the organization.
|Audit Log Viewers | Enables a user to access to the UI for the Audit Log under Access Management.
|Cloudhub Admin | Provides access to all Runtime Manager functionality.
|Cloudhub Developer |*(Deprecated)* Provides access to all Runtime Manager functionality, except organization and billing settings.
|Cloudhub Support |*(Deprecated)* Provides read-only access to dashboards, notifications, alerts, logs, and their user settings.
|Organization Administrators | Enables a user to edit to all versions of all APIs, all registered applications, and all API Portals in the Anypoint Platform. Access to the Organization Administration page, where they can add and manage users and roles, view and edit organization details, access API Manager > Client Applications, access the client ID and client secret for the organization, and customize the theme of the Developer Portal. +
Members of the Organization Administrator role also inherit the role of *API Creator* by default.
|Exchange Administrators | Manage Exchange Portal Enables a user to manage Exchange Portals, including customization, manage assets, manage reviews.
|Exchange Contributors | Enables a user to contribute Exchange assets and manage versions.
|Exchange Viewers | Enables a user to view and consume Exchange assets.
|===

=== Permission Scopes for Default Roles

Each default Role in Anypoint Platform holds pre-defined permissions with a _scope of actions_ that allow the user holding them specific actions within the platform: +

== To Create and Configure a Custom Roles

As an organization administrator, you can create custom roles by combining API resources, permissions, and users.

. Click the *Roles* tab in the left navigation of your Organization Administration page.
. Click *Add role*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for your custom role.
. Your custom role now appears in your list of roles. Click the name of your new role to assign permissions to it.

[WARNING]
When editing Role names and/or descriptions, use the 'Enter' key to save changes, clicking outside the text box cancels the edit without saving it. 

=== Assigning Permissions to Roles

By clicking a role name, you can access more information about that role, change its name and description, add permissions to it, or assign this role to specific users. +
Depending on the product to which the role is associated, these options may vary. For example, API roles cannot be removed and their permissions cannot be modified, however you can add a description and add users to that role.

Depending on the amount of products you own in the Anypoint Platform, the tabs displayed under the _Permissions_ tab vary as well. Usually it's one tab per product enabled on your organization.

By default, all Anypoint Platform accounts have *API* and *Runtime Manager* permissions. +

To add permissions to a role do the following:

. Make sure you're in the right business group
. Pick the Permissions tab
. Choose the product whose permissions you want to assign (a full list of permissions can be found in our link:/access-management/managing-permissions[permissions] section)
.. If you want to assign *API permissions*:
... Start typing your API name in the `Select the API resource by name` field
... Select the version of the API. You can also choose `all` to grant privileges to all versions of the API you selected
... Select the API permission you wish to grant. +
(API Permissions share the same name as API Roles and they grant the same privileges)
.. If you want to assign *Product Permissions*:
... Type in the name of one of the environments existing in your organization (if these environments belong to a business group, they are only available when creating a role in that same business group)
... Now you are able to select what permissions to grant within that environment. You can also pick *Select All* to assign all permissions related to that environment to that role.
. Click the `+` icon towards the right to add those permissions to the role

[WARNING]
Note that product permissions are specific to a single environment, so if you have multiple environments and want to give a role the same permissions on all, you must add these permissions multiple times, one for each environment.


For a better understanding of how permissions work within the Anypoint Platform, see our link:/access-management/managing-permissions[permissions] section.

[CAUTION]
--
If the only permissions associated with your role are *Portal Viewer*​ and/or ​*Exchange Viewer*​ and/or ​*Application Owner*​, then users belonging to this role won't have access to the organization's support portal.
--

== Role Mapping

You can set up your Anypoint Platform organization so that when a SAML user belongs to certain groups, Anypoint Platform automatically grants certain equivalent roles in your Anypoint Platform organization.
