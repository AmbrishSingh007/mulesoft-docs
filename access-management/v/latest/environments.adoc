= Environments

Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate environments for deploying, which are independent from each other. +
Environments can either be of *production* or *sandbox* type. By default, when creating a new organization you get one production environment named *Production*.

Sandbox environments are helpfully restrictive environments for developers and testers, they facilitate safe testing of applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team in which they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment, thereby securing production and eliminating the risk of a developer accidentally operating upon an application in production. After you are sure an application is safe to expose to users, you can easily promote the application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

== Managing Environments

_Admin Only_

To create or manage environments, access the corresponding menu by clicking the menu icon at the top right of the screen and clicking *Environments*:

To add an environment, click *Add environment*. Add a name, click *Production* or *Sandbox*, and click *Create*.

To rename or delete an environment, click its entry in the table.

In the *Edit environment* menu:

* *Update*: Change the name and click *Update*. 
* *Delete*: To delete an environment, click *Delete*.

You can't grant users access to an environment directly, you must do it through the use of roles. To grant a role permissions to access your new environment, see link:/access-management/roles#assigning-permissions-to-roles[Assigning Permissions to Roles].

[NOTE]
Depending on the type of subscription you have on CloudHub, you may be restricted to creating a limited amount of each kind of environment.

=== Client ID and Client Secret

Each environment has a client ID and a client secret used for authentication. You must use these values to  configure a customer-hosted Mule Runtime or legacy API Gateway to be able to deploy proxies or APIs to CloudHub.

To view the client ID and secret for your environment: 

. Log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator.
. Click Environments.
. Click the name of the environment whose client ID/secret you want to view.

[NOTE]
--
To change the client ID or client secret of an environment, you must contact your customer support representative.
