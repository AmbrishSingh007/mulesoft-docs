= Environments

Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments.  These environments are independent from each other and enable you to test your applications under the same conditions as your production environment. 

An environment can be either production or sandbox type. By default, when creating a new organization, it contains only one environment named Production. Sandbox environments are useful environments for development and testing. They enable you to safely test an application without affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team where they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment. This helps to secure your production environment and eliminate the risk of a developer accidentally changing an application in production. After you are sure an application is safe to expose to users, you can easily promote the application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

== Adding Users to an Environment

You cannont grant users access to an environment directly. To grant a user access to an environment use role permissions. See link:/access-management/roles#assigning-permissions-to-roles[Assigning Permissions to Roles] for more information.
