= About Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (PCE)

This topic provides a general description of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition enables you to install and manage components of the management plan:

* Anypoint Runtime Manager: track and manage your deployed Mule applications.
* Anypoint API Manager: deploy and manage APIs and define proxies.
* Anypoint Exchange: share various assets within your organization that can be reused across integration projects.
* Access Management: grant access to various platform components and functions by specifying permissions and roles for your users.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition enables you to run and manage Mule applications on customer-managed servers. This enables you to define and control the security policies your system requires. When running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, MuleSoft systems do not interact with your data. You can configure and run all platform components and maintain all storage, processing and transmission of data. 

To manage this infrastructure, Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses Docker and Kubernetes to provide built-in high availability and scalability.
