== Where is OSv2 available?

APAC: Tokyo (ap-northeast-1), Singapore (ap-southeast-1), and Sydney (ap-southeast-2).
EU: Frankfurt (eu-central-1), Ireland (eu-west-1), and London (eu-west-2).
North America: Central Canada (ca-central-1), Northern Virginia (us-east-1), and Oregon (us-west-2). 
South America: Sao Paulo (sa-east-1).

== Is OSv2 persistent in the same region as the worker?

Yes. For example, if you deploy to the Singapore region, the object store persists in the Singapore region.

== How long can data persist in OSv2?

30 days if there is no change to the data for a key. The Time to Live (TTL) is per object store application. 
If a TTL is not specified, Object Store sets the TTL for the application to 30 days. You can set the TTL from 
either the ObjectStore connector's Entry Ttl field or from the REST API. Each time the data for a key 
updates, the expiration date extends by 30 days. If the data is not updated after 30 days, the data is deleted. 

== What's the maximum number of keys that can persist in OSv2?

In OSv2 there is no limit on the number of keys per application. In Object Store v1, the limit was 100,000 keys and attempts to store more were rejected.

== Where is the OSv2 REST API portal?

This API is available in the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform-eng/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/object-store-v2/[Anypoint Platform Developer's portal].

== Where is the Object Store connector?

Anypoint Exchange provides assets for the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.modules/mule-module-objectstore/[Mule 3 Object Store connector] and the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.connectors/mule-objectstore-connector/[Mule 4 Object Store connector]. In Mule 4, OSv2 is a core connector that is pre-installed in Mule 4 and in Anypoint Studio 7. Note: The Mule 3 Object Store connector writes a key-value pair, whereas the Mule 4 Object Store connector writes a key-list pair. 

== Do I need a different Object Store connector for Object Store v2 and Object Store v1?

The Mule 3 Object Store connector works for both OSv1 and OSv2. The Mule 4 Object Store connector only works with OSv2. 

== Are there rate limits on OSv2?

Free accounts are rate limited to 10 transactions per second per application. Premium customers who purchase the Object Store SKU have no rate limits; however, the number of API requests premium customers can make is limited by their subscription value. If a free account application exceeds the rate limit, the 429 HTTP status code results.

== Can OSv2 be shared between workers?

An Object Store and its contents (keys, values) is accessible to all CloudHub workers of the one Mule application that defines and therefore owns that Object Store. However, other Mule applications and the CloudHub workers on which they execute cannot access this Object Store and its contents. If needed, you can use the REST API to read from one application and store to another.

////
== Does Object Store replicate cached data across CloudHub workers?

Data stored in Object Store V1 or V2 is in a separate service that is accessible 
to any CloudHub worker in a single application, and is shared across workers. Data
only goes to Object Store V2, if you set `objectStore-ref="_defaultUserObjectStore"`
in your Mule XML flow. If not set, Object Store references stay in-memory in a 
single worker.  

Mule 3 example XML flow:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<objectstore:config name="ObjectStore__Connector" partition="mypartition"
 objectStore-ref="_defaultUserObjectStore" doc:name="ObjectStore: Connector"/>
----

////

== Can OSv2 be used on premises?

No, but applications running on-premises can use the OSv2 REST API to store data in OSv2 and retrieve it.

== How is OSv2 data secured?

Object Store v2 uses TLS for secure transport. Data at rest is stored using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards.

== How can I hide sensitive data in Object Store?

We recommend that you encrypt sensitive data before writing it to the Object Store.

== Does Object Store cache data or do I/O for each read and write?

Object Store V2 does I/O for each read and write. With Object Store V2, the API call is localized to the 
same data center as the Runtime Manager application.
