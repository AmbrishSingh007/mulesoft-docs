= Anypoint Object Store V2
:imagesdir: ./_images

Object Store v2 lets applications store data and states across batch processes 
and Mule components, from within a single application. OSv2 acts as the 
backend for Mule 3 and Mule 4 object store access, which enables applications 
to write directly to object store, use its REST API, and write and read using 
the Object Store connector. See the link:/object-store/osv2-faq[FAQ] for  
Object Store information.

Object Store v2 provides:

* Persistent storage of objects with a flexible time to live (TTL) up to 30 days. The TTL updates on every write to the object store value. See link:/object-store/osv2-faq#how-long-can-data-persist-in-osv2[How long can data persist in OSv2?].
* Supports unlimited keys.
* Fully integrated with the Anypoint Platform.
* Full HA across availability zones within a region.
* Data co-located in the same region as your deployed Mule applications.
* Mule connector for Mule applications and REST interface for external applications.
* End-to-end secure transport and storage. Object Store v2 uses TLS for secure transport. 
* Data at rest is stored using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards.
* Stores values up to 10 MB in size. 
* Confirmable timeout to enable rollbacks.

You can use the existing Object Store Connector to create applications that write data to the object store.

Object Store v2 contains a user interface available in the Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager. 

== Upgrading to Object Store v2

* Back up all the data in your current object store.
+
IMPORTANT: Data does not carry over from Object Store v1 to v2.  Any data you have in your v1 object store, including watermarks and other Mule component states, will be lost after switching to v2.
+
* To access Object Store v2, in Anypoint Platform, click Runtime Manager. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard, and click Manage Application. In the Settings screen, click Use Object Store v2. Accept the prompt. The Application Data section of the Runtime Manager's Dashboard changes to Object Store.
